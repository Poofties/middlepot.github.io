・ if you want to suicide for any reason rembeber that you will go through your problems like many other people<br>
・ say to yourself that you will wait 24 hours before doing it. or more. feelings and action are two different things, just because you feel that like killing yourself you don't actually have to do it right now<br>
・ people often choose suicide to relief their pain. remember that relief is a feeling and you need to be alive to feel it. you won't find relief if you're dead<br>
・ instead of ending your life, try to begin it.<br>
・ if something goes wrong, never give up! always try to look at the bright side<br>
・ cherish the great things on your life<br>
・ bad thoughts are not welcome !!!<br>
・ socialize, even if you don't want to be around anyone<br>
・ talk to new people, just for talk<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">how to fall back in love with life :</font><br><br>
・ clean your room, clean space, clean the dishes, sweep. take out the trash. peel the clothes off the floor and wash them, and then actually fold / hang them. take a long shower. scrub behind your knees. brush your teeth ( this can be utterly exhausting, but try to get it done in a day, if you can. the end result is worth it i promise ! )<br>
・ pull out your notebook. it doesn't need to be a new notebook, but preferably one that you don't usually write in, or that you haven't touched in a while. a cute one will work fine. sit in your room, or in the park, or in the library, and write a list. count clouds. describe all the colors that you see, and note patterns that arise. sketch the cracks in the walls. note the shape light makes when it enters a space. talk about what the air tastes like, smells like. what sounds are there ? even the white nose, break that down : air planes, fans, cicadas, anything. remind yourself that you are sitting in the middle of a space brimming with detail. remind yourself that you are not in nothingness and emptiness. your world is fathomless. it has potential<br>
・ drink cold water and try to eat something that isn't processed. it doesn't need to be fancy. buy yourself an apple with the change between your couch cushions. eat it outside. if you're someone who walks, walk somewhere afterwards, just to stretch your legs. take your meds. remember that it's a good thing that you are inside your body. your body is a fantastic and endlessly intricate machine, and even though society has smacked a bunch of poisonous ideas on it, that doesn't change its inherent worth and splendor. take care of it !<br>
・ read a novel. underline your favorite lines, and write phrases that twist your heart inside your chest on the back of your hand with an ink pen. read a novel like it's poetry. read poetry, something decadent but unpretentious. watch a movie you haven't seen before. if there are free art galleries near you, walk through one. take your time. let yourself bask. if there are patterns in what makes your soul ache, write those patterns down : marbles arches or soot crumbling bricks or dandelions or descriptions of dresses or whatever it is, write them down<br>
・ your chosen family is important. remember, they picked you as much as you picked them. the love has no obligation. it is given freely and it is given from a place of compassion. you are not a burden. if you need to breathe, take a minute by yourself and just exist, but remember to go back to your people. when they need you, listen and be gracious. always be gracious. the universe sometimes remembers things like that<br>
・ listen to new music. listen to something that you don't usually listen to.  we tend to tie up a lot of memory with music. we are falling in love again. the soundtrack needs to be specific to that<br>
・ allow yourself to indulge in romantics. press flowers in old books. play movies with subtitles and mouth the words. dance in your room. wear something that makes you feel good, even if you wouldn't wear it in public. write your chosen family letters, even if you hand deliver them. write poetry, even awful poetry. revel in its awfulness. eat dark chocolate. when your chosen family want to go out, try to go out with them sometimes, even if it's just to the market !<br>

・ remember, feelings of panic are just exaggerations of normal bodily stress reactions.<br>
・ sensations are neither harmful nor dangerous - just unpleasant. nothing worse will happen.<br>
・ stop adding to the panic with frightening thoughts of where panic will lead.<br>
・ stay in the present. be aware of what is happening to you rather than concern yourself with how much worse it might get.<br>
・ wait and give fear time to pass.<br>
・ notice that when you stop adding to panic with frightening thoughts, the fear begins to fade.<br>
・ focus on coping with facing the fear rather than trying to avoid it or escape from it.<br>
・ lock around you. plan what you will do next as the panic subsides.<br>
・ think about the progress made so far, despite all the dificulties.<br>
・ when you are ready to go on, do so in an easy, relaxed manner. there is no hurry.<br>
・ each time you cope with panic, you reduce your fear !<br>

・ face and accept what happened, supression doesn't work as long-term solution<br>
・ identify the lessons you learned from what happened and write them in a notebook. everytime you have painful memories just read the lessons<br>
・ don't forget : the past experiences does not determine who you are, you're a strong person now and only you can choose your future and the person you want to be<br>
・ always seek peace. when you're at peace, old painful memories have less power<br>
・ always focus and live in the present<br>
・ forgive ( for your own sake ) try to heal from what happened then let it go. don't get attatched to what happened<br>
・ the daily struggles worth it because one day you'll be free<br>

・ look around you and try to find 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste<br>
・ stop whatever you are doing! you may end later when you're feeling better, you need to take care of yourself at the moment! you'll not get anywhere if you don't stop everything and focus on anxiety.<br>
・ occupy all your senses will help you a lot. i usually eat something very soft ( i can also touch it ) and good for my taste, like bread, a soft cake or pudding while watching some relaxing video<br>
・ anxiety attacks happen because you start hyperventilating; whenever you start feeling anxiety symptoms dont be scared, just remember those symptoms is your brain telling you to breathe because youre not breathing properly. therefore, breathe deeply<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">what to do when people are spreading rumors about you :</font><br><br>
・ you know whether or not this information is real, whether it's false or whether it's misinterpreted, then you must first calm down and reflect on your situation<br>
・ do not talk about it until you know what to say, do not write huge texts, do not record videos crying, it will only make you look like an immature and dramatic person !<br>
・ talk to someone you trust about what people are talking about, it's important to vent at those times, so you will know what to do and you will not feel the need to vent publicly<br>
・ if it's real information: but you feel bad about the way people are talking about it, if it's something you did not want anyone to know, it depends on your case and the seriousness of the subject. you can talk about how you feel about it, justify your actions or just ignore. remember not to turn it into a drama because it will not help. if it's something that you can change and improve, go for it, be strong, accept criticism. if it's something you have no control over, do not blame yourself, do not blame others. being a mature person and staying calm is the best way to deal with such situations<br>
・ if it's false information: you can try to clear things up, try to get proof if you can. don't worry about people's reaction to this, because who cares and trusts you will believe your words. do not keep on the subject for too long, be brief and quick. if you didn't do anything wrong, you have no reason to worry !<br>
・ in any case: do not offend anyone, do not exaggerate in words, do not become a victim, do not turn the situation into a great drama. this is very important and only then people will take you seriously<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">problems with blood pressure :</font><br><br>
・ if you feel you are sick or is going to faint, watch for symptoms before taking further action. just in case, it is best to sit down, breathe deeply, drink some water and get help<br>
・ DO NOT take action if you are unsure of how's your pressure ! this is very important. for example if you take water with sugar and your blood pressure is low, you will probably feel worse because it only helps in cases of high blood pressure. so don't try to do anything alone if you are not absolutely sure what happened, just relax and have a glass of water.<br>
・ a way to distinguish the symptoms of high blood pressure or low pressure is that during low pressure, the individual tends to feel weak, drowsy, blurred vision and with the sensation that will pass out, while the high pressure is most frequent feel the heart pounding, persistent headache and double or blurred vision. however, the most effective way is to differentiate measuring the blood pressure.<br>
・ in the event of high pressure, the individual must take an orange juice and try to calm down, because the orange helps regulate the pressure to be diuretic and rich in potassium and magnesium. sugar + water also helps. if you take some medicine for high blood pressure prescribed by the doctor, you should take it. if after one hour the pressure still remain high, you must go to the hospital to take medicine to lower blood pressure.<br>
・ in the event of low pressure, you must sit in a cool place, loosen your clothes and elevate your legs in order to increase blood circulation in the brain and regulate blood pressure. when symptoms of low pressure passed, you can get up normally, however, must rest and avoid making sudden movements. put a pinch of fine salt under the tongue should help too.<br>

・ a child who have diabetes can't eat sweets at all - wrong. she can, it's just have to be a little better planed, together with her dinner.<br>
・ if the glucose value jump up and down, you have done something wrong. - wrong. even if you have the proper doses and insulin sort, and you have done what you can, your child's glucose value can still jump up and down. some children are hard to hold an a level of 5-7 mmol.<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">insomnia :</font><br><br>
・ give preference to eat light and nutritious food especially at night<br>
・ always try to sleep and wake up the same time, including on weekends<br>
・ take a relaxing warm bath and stay a moment in a calm and peaceful environment before going to sleep. read something instead of watching tv or use the internet can help bring sleep well<br>
・ take a soothing tea such as lemon balm or valerian about 30 minutes before going to bed<br>
・ i don't recommend listening to music while sleeping, unless it is a very soft music and with low volume. listen to loud music all night can do harm to your ears, and give a headache !<br>
・ i highly recommend ASMR videos ( if you don't know what that means, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response" target="_blank" id="linklinklink">here</a> ) ! i have an asmr playlist you can check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsBmCEP2InOp69wlTeQKg7GnB2EG5apxD" target="_blank" id="linklinklink">here</a><br>
・ if you go to watch videos before bed just watch those that will relax you and make you sleepy. please be sure to use a blue light filter to do no harm to your eyesight, and i recommend just listening to the audio at minimum volume for faster sleep. ( don't forget to take off your earphones before falling asleep )<br>
・ make a diary of your sleep ! write down the time you woke up, the number of hours slept and the quality of your sleep. this will help you improve<br>
・ if you are sleeping properly, will have no trouble getting up early. if still, try to deal quickly with something to wake up on time: get out of the bed quickly and prepare some coffee, take your phone, play some games or see your social networks, detach from your bed, the day started !<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">fear of abandonment :</font><br><br>
・ you must tie in your mind : you are not a bad person. you have many qualities and if you realize this you will know that there is no reason for anyone to abandon you. write down a list of your qualities, all you can think of, and then your bad side. you will realize that your bad side is your fears and insecurities ( or very small and irrelevant things ). they can be overcome and improved, they are not part of your personality, different from your qualities ( you're absolutely good enough !! )<br>
・ people come and go in your life, just like you do in their lives. this is not bad or wrong, even though it can be very painful when it happens to you, it's a natural process and doesn't mean that they don't like you or that you are less important. it was not something you did, it's not anyone's fault. it's life following its course, just how seasons change and time passes ( and yes they can come back, be patient )<br>
・ it's common to think of patterns to understand people's attitudes and "fix" them so they wouldn't "punish" you anymore. this doesn't work because it is not really something that has to do with you, people have their own reasons to move away from others and can not be avoided. enjoy every second and don't think about it because it will only cause suffering and disrupt your happy memories ( which are surely eternal )<br>

・ turn out the lights and open the windows, whatever the time is, whatever the weather. feel the natural light, the smells that come from outside, the sounds, the breeze on your face. you are part of nature.<br>
・ drink a large glass of water, eat a fruit. feel the flavors, the textures. feel how you swallow and how your body appreciates all your efforts in keeping you healthy. you are alive.<br>
・ take off your clothes and touch your skin and hair. notice how the textures are different, how some parts are warmer than others. feel the softness and endurance of your body. you are perfect.<br>
・ look carefully at all the small details of the environment you are in. look for life : small plants, small bugs, even mold. write down everything interesting that you have found. look out the window and see the sights, the world is so big. you are never alone.<br>
・ go outside, step barefoot on the grass. take a deep breath, feel your heartbeat. lie down on the grass and start writing and scribbling all you can think of, all random words, weird shapes. write down your little wishes, what you want from the bottom of your heart right now. don't think much, just vent. you are pure.<br>
・ put instrumental music to play as a soundtrack for your life. choose something that is compatible with your feelings. dance in the moonlight. you are real.<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">things to release endorphins in everyday life :</font><br><br>
・ endorphins are the hormones that make us feel happy and are important because they avoid depression, anxiety and keeps us motivated + with good self-esteem. these are things i usually do to release endorphins in a practical way when i'm feeling sad :<br>
・ oxytocin : give and receive gifts and compliments !!!<br>
・ dopamine : fulfill little tasks, start new projects !!!<br>
・ serotonin : feel happy nostalgia, discover new cool things !!!<br>
・ endorphin : watch or read dramatic stories, dance and sing !!!<br>
・ anandamina : eating bitter chocolate is always good !!!<br>
・ exercising always helps a lot to release endorphins ! it can be something like organizing and cleaning, the important thing is to spend energy<br>
・ interacting with other people is also very good, but this should be done carefully so as not to force yourself to hold uncomfortable conversations and bad relationships, or overwhelm others with your need. being happy alone is the most important !!<br>
・ be careful not to start bad practices when you feel the lack of endorphins. whenever you feel discouraged, before you do something think whether or not this is good for you, for real. it's easy to make mistakes and feel addicted to doing things that hurt us ( and hurt others ) due to lack of endorphins<br>
・ remember that it is natural to feel desires ( sometimes selfish or even immoral ), but you are conscious and strong enough, always think before you act and everyting will be fine ♡ !<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">selfishness x self respect :</font><br><br>
・ selfishness is putting the wants of yourself over the needs of others.<br>
・ self respect is putting the needs of yourself over the wants of others.<br>
・ one is disregarding others, one is taking care of yourself.<br>
・ the difference between the two is the difference between being a friend and a doormat.<br>
・ taking care of yourself does not make you a bad person !!!!<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">how to stay on top of life when feeling sad :</font><br><br>
・ acknowledge how you feel, and accept that this is going to be a more challenging day<br>
・ commit to doing the absolute essentials but don't push yourself to do everything<br>
・ prioritize what's important. for example, if you have a paper due that is worth a large percentage of your marks, work on that. if it is something that can wait, set it aside for now.<br>
・ work through your to-do list in small chunks of time - making sure you get plenty of breaks<br>
・ tell someone who will understand. we need to get support when we're feeling low but not everyone will be there for you. figure out who will be there, and who won't<br>
・ be wise in your use of social media. it may be good to go offline for a while, to switch off your phone and to protect yourself from stuff that just exacerbates the way you feel<br>
・ make sure you leave the house and get a change of scenery<br>
・ deliberately invest in some form of self-care, and make sure it’s something that you know will help your mood<br>
・ remember that tomorrow is another day !<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">how to have healthy friendships :</font><br><br>
・ it's normal for some people not to want new friends, when approaching someone don't think about rejection as something personal. you're not boring or annoying because someone doesn't want to have new friends !<br>
・ everyone needs time to do their own thing and to talk to other people, if a friend is distant it doesn't necessarily mean that they don't want to talk to you or is tired of you. most likely it's nothing directly related to you.<br>
・ you don't have to be close to someone to be a good friend to them and exchange good times together ! it's okay to interact less intimately with other people, you don't have to force approach or feel less valid by not being their best friend.<br>
・ having groups of friends is fun, but it's also very romanticized. the larger the group, the more people in it don't really feel included, so valuing the few friendships is what's really important. having individual friends is not a bad thing, even because in groups of friends, there are always some that are closer to each other, it's not really possible to be extremely close to so many people equally !!<br>
・ having virtual friends is no less relevant than having friends in real life, you can still exchange experiences, feelings and even be very close without being literally close! many real-life friendships are superficial, which proves that what really matters is that your hearts are connected.<br>
・ being someone's best friend is not the most important thing in the world, you are still equally valid and can make people happy not being their best friend. by the way, what makes someone your best friend is more a matter of time, and doesn't really relate to who you are. if you simply were not lucky enough to have a close friendship for many years it doesn't say anything about who you are because it's just luck !<br>
・ friends who go away is normal and part of life ; people start new phases and new experiences and often don't have as much time to keep as many friends as they have before ( often they can't keep any ). take this opportunity to meet new people, because there are so many lovely people to meet you ! whine for something that wasn't anyone's fault is not worth it.<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">how to deal with loneliness :</font><br><br>
・ start new hobbies! there are endless fun activities to do that will take up your time. some things like crafts, reading, writing, gardening ; all activities you do alone, anyway.<br>
・ watch movies, series, play something new and fun ! get new interests that will make you very happy and busy.<br>
・ now that you have several new interests and hobbies, you'll find it much easier to meet nice people with common interests. look for groups of people and make new friends ! you will surely have lots of fun and will feel better.<br>
・ maybe you already have friends but they are not giving you as much attention as you would like.. in that case just looking for new friends is not going to help as much as you clearly are a person who has a heart that produces too much love and needs fuel to keep it running .. so spread this love to other people too, instead of overloading your friends :<br>
・ enter social media where you can anonymously talk to someone you admire and tell everything you think about them. you will surely feel very happy when you see that made someone smile !<br>
・ enter random chat servers and have fun talking random things with strangers. just talking what you want and laughing a little is sometimes necessary, relationships are complicated and can make you overwhelmed or needy.<br>
・ if you can, have a pet !! maybe you already have one, so go play with it, now !<br>
<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">how to deal with losses :</font><br><br>
・ maybe you have lost something you like really much or someone very important is no longer in your life. whatever the case, the first thing you must do is accept what happened. you are probably now trying to forget and not think about it, but you remember from time to time and it hurts your heart ; so what i suggest to you is that you start writing honestly what you feel about that loss. describe why it was important to you and what you used to feel about it, write why you are missing it. describe your feelings as accurately as you can, and you can scribble and draw some things that you can't describe with words.<br>
・ cry, you can cry. there is no problem in crying for a loss. cry as much as you want to cry, even though it seems that you will never tire of crying, at some point you will feel tired and you will be able to feel more relieved. accepting your sadness is important, suppressing feelings hurts the heart and is not healthy !<br>
・ read what you wrote earlier and try to make a list of things you would like to continue living to feel good like before even without the presence of what you have lost. you will certainly be able to experience similar happy experiences, even if you can't replace people. happy emotions are similar and have similar weight in your life, and that's why time will make you feel more relieved.<br>
・ now is the time to try to be distracted and not think so much about your loss. focus on what you want to feel and the experiences you want to live and what you can do to reach them, and focus no more on your loss and past experiences. you have a lot of potential to live incredible things and be very happy !!!<br>
・ try to start doing something new that you have always been insecure of or afraid to try. start with simple things : change your hair, rearrange your room, delete and redo your social media.. get a new pet, make new friends ! even the small changes will help you to accept that you are now in a new phase and need to do your best to get it started.<br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Whw2SOT.png"> <font color="#b29372" style="font-size:9px">how to keep a healthy conversation :</font><br><br>
・ if you're too quiet : you probably feel like you have nothing interesting to say and that you'll bother if you try to start a conversation. important : you certainly always have something interesting in front of you and you just didn't notice it. try to comment on what you are doing and ask about the other person's day. sharing interesting, funny or cute content you've seen is also a way to keep in touch without talking too much if it makes you anxious.<br>
・ if you feel uncomfortable asking questions and "invading" other people's space, know that they usually feel good about knowing someone is interested in them. ask questions about things that you would be interested in responding to as well, and say that if the person doesn't want to respond it's okay. they certainly will not feel pressured in this way and you'll be able to know them better and be closer.<br>
・ if someone is venting or telling you something, be sure to make comments and questions about it so you can show that you are paying attention. you don't necessarily have to use words or give advice or say anything about yourself, just show that you are there and that you are interested and not bothered by the conversation. try to make them feel valid, it's enough.<br>
<br>
・ if you're too talkative : you probably feel afraid of silence and not being present and you always want to comment on something. the silence is important and will not necessarily keep you distant from people. silence don't have to be uncomfortable. everyone has their time to talk and you too can have yours.<br>
・ think before you speak. think if what you're going to say really is a nice subject and not just something to "fill the empty space". there is no need to break the silence to say anything. when starting a subject ask a question to understand if it's the person's interest before continuing to speak. if the person doesn't seem interested, you don't have to find another subject ; just let it go. if the person is interested, be careful to give time to the other person. be careful not to talk unnecessarily or repeat things. try to keep the same pace as the other person : after speaking, encourage them to talk too and wait until they finish and then you can comment on what they said. if they are not speaking so much, try to keep short sentences too ; if they are talking enough, you can talk more too.<br>
・ you don't have to be the first and last to speak. if no one is talking, don't be that first one to start the subject every time. if someone is speaking, you don't always have to respond with words. don't always try to prolong the subject because you'll be ignored, once no one is interested in it.<br>
・ if you need to vent or say something important and complicated, try writing what you think alone before talking to someone. by saying everything at once to someone, you may end up talking too much and overloading them with information. if you have already written what you feel before, you will be able to express yourself with few words and you'll not feel embarrassed in the end.<br>
