i'm very proud of the result, what do you think ?<br>
<br>
umm and i also have something super very special that i found and despite having exited a lot to post here because i am extremely shy with my voice, i think it's worth it, because i worked hard !<br>
that's from a couple of years ago, when i was part of a small cover group with some friends. i had a very bad microphone, so i got a new one and recorded some songs and my friend edited.<br>
i'm very shy, so i didn't show to many people besides them and it ended up getting lost in time. luckily, i backed up this specific song, my fav one. i decided to post here today :<br>

i don't have the microphone anymore, but i'd like to buy another. i don't think i'd record more songs because it's really hard for me, but maybe i could talk to you fluffies ?<br>
i think it might be a good idea, please give me suggestions !!<br>
<br>
so, i'm not going to do a q&a today, sorry ; ;<br>
but i have something stuck in my throat and i really need to vent :<br>
<br>
please : <b>stop spreading hate</b> !!!!!!<br>
i've seen a lot of people all over internet spreading hate to feel better about their problems, and hate is NEVER the solution !<br>
hating people will not help you or make you a better person, it's immature and very very bad !<br>
writing about solutions, about what you think it's bad and must be helped ( almost everything can be helped if you try your best ) is important, but hating people is just not right !<br>
how do you expect things to get better by making other people hate you because you hate them !?<br>
nature is sure to teach you to value the really important things in life, and you can be sure that it is not internet drama.<br>
please, be kinder <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SpNv58B.gif"/><br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GuYGws3.gif"/><br>
today's post will be important to me, so i hope you enjoy it ! i'm a lil bit sleepy but i'll try hard to write everything right <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bAZEHQJ.gif"/><br>
so, i think i never told you but i like to make a lot of papercrafts and paper houses, i also have a wooden house that i want to paint and decorate ( when it's done i'll show you for sure )<br>
i am a frequent papercraft maker and i also like to gift, i live in a very humid place so it's hard to keep paper things ...<br>
some nice things i made i had to throw away because of the mold ; ;<br>
so i just keep with me my ult favs clean and organized so as not to ruin !<br>
i have here at the moment two medium houses, five small houses, the howl's moving castle ( which i'll show you ) and my super cute wooden house !!<br>
i don't know if i'll be able to keep the castle for so long, but i'll try to keep it clean !<br>
in the future i intend to set up a suitable and protected environment to store this kind of thing, to avoid dust and mold ( one of my big wishes is to collect sylvanian families !!! )<br>
<br>
aaand this is the castle, which took me an average of 6 months to make and i'm sooo proud of :<br>

i don't mind if you identify with them too ! i don't take it that seriously.<br>
( please don't call me by their names, because i don't like it ; ; )<br>
<br>
<br>
now, the subject i want to talk about is something that i think is extremely important, since i have seen it makes many people insecure, including me, and that was my conclusion about it :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
there's always a beauty competition between different people, races, species and even non-existencial things, and this is honestly so unhealthy !!<br>
there's even a thing called 2.5D wich is "almost non-real pretty" people. i think the desire of being perfect is normal, but it's also dangerous.<br>
people who know how to be beautiful in their best capacity, as healthy and captivating human beings, are really the ones who manage to be almost non-real, so you don't have to be artificial for it. if you try to be perfect you will fail because it's not possible. don't push the limits, just be yourself ! be the best version of yourself, the best you can be, always.<br>
you can't compare yourself with things you'll never be, it's very unhealthy. everything has totally diferent kind of beauties. 2D characters for example are usually made to be pretty besides they usually are not realistic enough to have the details that normal people have, so it's natural that you wanna be like that too. but we are made by nature itself. everything in nature is different and beautiful in its own way, and so are you. we are part of the nature. you don't have to worry about it, at all, because you don't have to be the perfect pretty to be happy.<br>
i think it's also very important to say that your body don't need to be pretty to keep you healthy and alive, and that's the more important thing ! beauty does not make you a good person, you have to work on it.<br>
beauty exist in many ways, i know it may sound cliché, but the inner beauty will really make you more and more beautiful to everyone, including to yourself.<br>
it's okay if you want to look at the mirror and be pleased, we like beautiful things. but it's not that hard. everyone have beauty parts to look at and feel happy. what people say it's pretty, it's not necessarily true for everyone. a good example is fashion, design and aesthetics : everyone have a different taste, even if it's more common to like some kind of clothes and aesthetics, maybe you like some things that are uncommon. it's the same thing, and that's why everything can be beautiful in some way ! you are beautiful in lots of ways, and if you don't believe it, just try to find things that make you happy about yourself and focus on that things !<br>
there's a special beauty in everyone. you are unique, and the cute features you have are purely luck, that's super special ! also, you can be even prettier if you work on being a better person every day, a perfect version of what it's possible for you to be. for example, there are small things that automatically make us feel more beautiful sometimes ( as fashion and makeup ). the most important thing is to feel comfortable and keep healthy. be proud of your race, your species and your existence. be proud of being you !<br>
<br>
please, think about it, because we usually forget some important points that would make us truly happier !!<br>
be kind to yourself <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5LHkYOP.gif"/><br>

i'm melting completely .. summer makes me so uncomfortable <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QbRprCw.gif"/><br>
it has been raining a lot, too. it's not the kind of nice rain you can get out with cute umbrellas and have fun, i'm talking about very scary thunderstorms !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/St54IDr.gif"/><br>
i wish the summer were not so extreme here ...<br>
it's difficult to do anything in this climate, but i wanted to paint some little things that i'll show here for you :<br>

do you think it got better ?<br>
<br>
so, today, i want to talk about a very important subject that i've been dealing with for years and it certainly bothers me a lot ; ;<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i am very interested in astrology and any other "pseudoscience", as well as personality tests, i usually read a lot about it.<br>
but i honestly don't like to talk about that kind of thing, not a little bit. the reason is that most of the time people think they can know everything about others from small information. this is obviously not true and makes me feel very uncomfortable and dissociated seeing people trying to know things about me without knowing me ! it's almost disrespectful, to be honest.<br>
i will not go into other subjects, i will just talk about astrology here, which is a very good example :
astrology is something very complex. people have birth charts, there are signs for each planet, alignments, houses, many details to study.<br>
astrologers study a lot to learn to correctly interpret and evaluate a birth chart, a very relevant example of how a chart can have diverse interpretations is that twins have identical birth charts, but may have completely different personalities.<br>
each person manifests parts of the chart differently, there is no standard for this. people, even so, make very heavy conclusions about others from just a few details of a person's birth chart. i think this is just so wrong, indeed annoying !<br>
for this reason, i do not like to talk about astrology or other similar subjects with almost anyone, i will not show you my birth chart here ever and i kindly ask you that please don't share stereotyped information about my solar sign with me, this makes me very sad.<br>
<br>
i hope you understand my point !<br>
i don't judge people who identify 100% with their solar signs and like this kind of stereotyped information, it just is not my case and i think it's bad that people don't respect it ..<br>
please be kind to others !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xbvdBR5.gif"/><br>

2018 !!!<br>
i really really hope this year to be full of hope, achievement and love for you all !!<br>
you have made me so happy since i made this website, i have just felt joy in updating it and bringing new things to you. thank you soooo much !<br>
the new years is always a complicated time to do things, so i have nothing really new to show here today .. i'm sorry <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xj1OmvF.gif"/><br>
but, i would like to make a small but very very important request today :<br>
<br><br>
please spread love, be kind to each other !!!<br>
you don't know how important it is and how it makes a difference on a person's day to receive a loving message.<br>
even if it's in anonymous, be sure to tell people you admire how much you love them, how special and incredible they are !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3xiRoNK.gif"/><br>
i promise you'll never regret doing it and it will feel great !<br>
spread love on the internet, spread love with letters and secret messages, spread words of love in every way you can !<br>
<br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QU4wxaT.gif"/></center><br>
<br><br>
sooo, today i don't have a q&a here as i have some updates on my tumblr about.<br>
i updated some little sutff about aesthetics + add :<br>
<br>
♡　i can't do personal posts because it would be extremely uncomfy for me, i just post personal stuff here on my website !!<br>
<br>
♡　i'm sorry, but i really can't reblog promos or do ask / tag games ( i just don't want my blog to be very personal, sorry /// you all are so lovely ; ; ) but it really warms my heart when people tag me in all kind of cute stuff, please feel free to send me everything you think i would like.<br>
<br>
♡　i can't pay attention to every single interaction, but i try my best to make sure i never reblog from bad people. if i interact with someone who is really toxic please tell me quickly, this is very important to me.<br>
<br>
♡　you are free to unfollow me, softblock to break mutuals or just hardblock me ! i just want you to be comfortable.<br>
<br>
♡　i always always read links and i interact with most personal posts i see, sometimes i can't because i'm too shy, i'm sorry ; ;<br>
<br>
♡　i absolutely love all my mutuals !!!!<br>
<br><br>
i would also like to say a little note about my little world on <a href="http://www.yourworldoftext.com" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">ywot</a> ! and this one goes to the faq :<br>
there is a little free space to talk, but if you already know this site, you know there is a huge amount of people who spam random text and ascii art in any free space you see.<br>
my space is blocked for pasting, which relieves spam a little bit, but there is still a simple script line that allows you to paste in any free space !<br>
i really like this site because i've met some really nice people in it, but the point is : there are lots of immature and dumb people who like to spam random offensive stuff or cursing. i don't really care about that, and i can easily erase that sort of thing ( and i always do it when i have the opportunity ) but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing i suggest you be careful ! take care ♡<br>
<br>
and that's it ! i'm sorry if this post was small, but i hope what i said is of some use to you<br>
i love you all so so so much !!! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8PfKwQX.gif"/><br>
thank you for being here for me !<br>

merry xmas !!!!! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZGSvNUX.gif"/><br>
my ult fav holiday, the time of year when i get listening to all ragnarok christmas bgm ( which i suggest to all of you, since it's what most helps me to get the christmas spirit )<br>
i think i never told you, but one of my biggest dreams is to see snow. i've NEVER seen snow, since where i live it doesn't snow.<br>
it may seem crazy to you, but it's true, and it makes me extremely sad that i never had a christmas with winter and snow !!<br>
in fact, summer has just arrived, and it is certainly about 30°C right now ...<br>
but the christmas spirit and a lot of ice cream always helps me feel better !<br>
i know that one day i will have a traditional christmas in the northern hemisphere, since my desire is to live there in some years. but that's a story for another post ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cq3logb.gif"/><br>
<br>
as you may have noticed, i still can't start with my shop, and summer has arrived ...<br>
i'm sorry for this, but i'm having some personal problems and it's difficult to make the items and organize everything ! besides that there are still some materials missing ...<br>
but i promise it will not be that long before sales start !<br>
<br>
coming back to christmas, i received a lovely gift from bubu : the paper doll mate coloring book <img src="https://i.imgur.com/R2rmMkX.gif"/><br>
it's something i was really longing for, and i'm so happy !!!<br>
it's definitely the cutest coloring book i've ever seen in my life, and i'm super excited to get started <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SKh3GVb.gif"/><br>
i've been looking for scanned pages of this book because i didn't want to paint it only once, i wanted to be able to paint as much as i wanted ( even digitally )<br>
as i didn't find anything, i decided to scan all the coloring pages myself, so the book can be perfect forever, as i can print the pages as many times as i want !<br>
i thought these pages could be a good christmas gift for you, so here they are :<br>

the book contains other pages with wonderful illustrations, texts, has high quality, and is adorable !<br>
i strongly suggest that you buy this book yourself, or give it as a gift to your loved ones <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GO9edJs.gif"/><br>
<br>
now, i would like to talk about this subject that has bothered me a lot on the internet because people are saying very rude things about each other just like a chain of hate ; ;<br>
this makes me very sad, and i feel that it's important spread positivity about it, although it is complicated to write about, i hope you understand my point :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
( before starting, i would like to point out that in referring to boys and girls i mean the natural female and male sides of people, such as the sexes ! )<br>
<br>
humans are animals, above all else. and animals are born boys or girls, to procreate and fulfill their roles in nature.<br>
human beings are rational animals, so sometimes we are not satisfied with what we're born from. our heart is pure and knows what is best for us, and we must be happy to make others happy.<br>
therefore, we can choose our role in nature ( and society, of course )<br>
but there is something very bad that affects our choices of heart that would make us happy and good : people choose what they are, what they like, their way of living and their roles in society, based on what others think is cool !<br>
this is an impure thought, for we should not change who we truly are only because "it's cool", we must be pure, be ourselves above all else.<br>
there is some kind of odious fashion where it says girls should live with the goal of being better than boys, and vice versa.<br>
and there is also another one that boys have built up today's society alone, and that girls have never helped at all.<br>
this is a very toxic thought that affects our lives and society, we should not be against each other !!<br>
<br>
boys and girls are no better than others, just different. biologically, we have some advantages and disadvantages over the other, but this is natural and there is nothing wrong.<br>
we are like cake and pudding, there is no better or worse, just personal preference !<br>
therefore, we can be who we really want, because our heart knows the right way.<br>
a society works well and happy when everyone is pure, are themselves, and so can fulfill their roles in society, happy and comfortable with their lives !<br>
the role of all people in society is to do good, to spread love and kindness, to bring education and health to others and to be happy. this can be done by all people when they are living stable and comfortable lives!<br>
you don't have to have children or form a family for it, if you don't want to, even if nature has made your body for it. what matters is meeting and knowing who you really are. if you feel confused, you are not happy and you do not make others happy.<br>
if you feel that getting married, having children and caring for the house would make you happy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, of course !<br>
even if your friends tell you that it would make you dependent and unhappy, does not mean it's true. economic independence is not really independence in life.<br>
people seek a happy society for all through toxic thoughts of superiority. we must work together as a family ! when we are together, the advantages and disadvantages of being a boy or girl does not matter, as they can complement each other in solving problems !<br>
we all have special abilities and unique talents. it may be difficult to find what we want to be and do in our lives, but it's very important that we do not follow the instincts or opinions of others, but the heart, which is who we certainly are.<br>
<br>
<br>
i'm sorry if i wrote many things repeated, i hope you can understand !<br>
i hope this has some good feeling for you, because the internet is full of people fighting over being better than the other and this makes me very upset ...<br>

i now have custom domains and ssl for my tumblrs !!<br>
i'm so happy about it, i managed to keep everything 100% covered with ssl, and i changed all the links, for the consistency.<br>
and now i've also put some html files online : the html tester ( milk.honey.my ), the offline ywot ( rosy.latteart.fi ) and also a new page of unicode text converters ( safe.babyhugs.cl ) !<br>
i like collecting unicodes, and there are some "unicode fonts" that few people know about and i think it's cool to share ! these converters were made by me for easier use.<br>
i had doubts between using tumblr or github to host those files, and i chose github. unfortunately i can't use ssl for these, at least for now <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bAXd801.gif"/><br>
the domains are so lovely, right ? <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qSScj23.gif"/></sub><br>
they are safe, since i'm using for static pages, but they are not mine so i have no guarantee that they will work forever ; ;<br>
anyway i will keep the links page updated, and for security, the html files are here, as always :<br>

well, about links, there's something i need to say, even if people don't really seem to care about it, i do care :<br>
i like to put links the right way: if it's http, i put http, if it's https, i put https, if it's www, i put www, if it's not www, i don't put www. i do that for all the links i put, everywhere, because i think this is the right thing to do ; i don't want people to click on a link that is different from the reality, i don't think it's right.<br>
but, i want to get ssl to this website ( someday, because it's hard to adapt everything ) and well... it's http so all the links are http ( it was once www but it doesn't really make a difference ), and when it's https i think i can't change ALL THE LINKS EVERYWHERE... like, i can do that, but it's too many links and i'll certainly forget about some link somewhere and it will cause total inconsistense, which i think is even worse. that's okay because all the navigators as i know, convert links with http to https if it's the case, so i don't need to change it. the problem could be otherwise ( https to http ) because there will be a security problem with scripts and hosted stuff, which is not the case ; so i'll keep all the links http, if you don't mind ! let me know what you think !<br>
i just wanted to say this to keep you informed <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xi8k93o.gif"/><br>
<br>
as i said in the last post, this post will be very special, so i have here also a piano composition :<br>

　　　　　( there's more, you can ask )<br>
<br>
i really don't define them as ids because it's a little complicated to do that, but i can say i identify with them a lot & they are really heartwarming for me !<br>
that being said, i don't care at all if you like them too.<br>
actually, i don't feel that doubles ever make people invalid, but i think it's always okay to seek comfort, right ? i just can't agree with people being mean with each other ; ;<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eU2a6A1.gif"/><br>
as you can see, i did a new layout !!<br>
i planned to do this layout for next year, but i had problems with the server and would have to readjust all the pages for the new one, so i took the opportunity to finish the layout right now.<br>
i hope you are enjoying it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vp28uvY.gif"/><br>
i updated several pages with new content and refined the portfolio !<br>
even the chat is also with new look and new emojis.<br>
<br>
if you want to know, the server i was using was weebly. i liked it, it was a good server, but one day suddenly they ignored my payment plan and said i was not entitled to premium services, even if i had confirmed the plan and everything !!<br>
they simply put a banner on my site, which made me very angry <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MofgDxY.gif"/><br>
i sent several messages and they, besides taking many days to respond, were rude with me <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OpBggFY.gif"/><br>
so i decided to switch servers. now, i use github, which has a good reputation and is very interesting to use, even because my site is static so i don't need complicated tools to edit it.<br>
<br>
well, these days i felt like repainting some old sketches. i'm having a lot of fun watching my progress !!<br>
this was the first one i repainted :<br>

halloween is coming, is coming !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JYt2us2.gif"/><br>
( a little sad here because living in the southern hemisphere is awful, it's spring now, super anticlimatic )<br>
anyway, i'm going to eat a lot of pumpkin candy and the heat will never stop me !!!!<br>
and how is your halloween going to be like ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DQwIi6u.gif"/><br>
<br>
sooo, i made a new flash game for milky woods !<br>
this time i got the urge to draw teddies, and i promise i'll stop LOL<br>
i decided to deactivate my dA account, i was pretty inactive there ...<br>
because of my inactivity, i never bothered to become a core, and my profile was pretty messed up for some time. recently, i have slightly customized, editing texts, avatar and gallery, so it was cute, but really, i don't have much to do there.<br>
maybe you noticed that i'm deactivating some inactive accounts, and that's because i'm trying to get rid of unnecessary social media ; ;<br>
the accounts that i keep online but inactive, is because i use them to keep contact with some people !<br>
i don't keep contact with anyone specifically on dA, so i think it's for the best to just deactivate.<br>
don't worry, i'm still going to make flash games and post here periodcly, as i promised !!<br>
if you came here from my dA account, i'm sorry for the inconvenience, you can still play all the games right <a href="http://middlepot.com/milky-woods" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">here</a><br>
aaand, here is the little game :<br>

please tell me what you think !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2R78VEf.gif"/><br>
<br>
today, i would like to talk about something that would be interesting, since some of you know me through projects, and others, well before that.<br>
before i create the name "middlepot" :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
what did i do on the internet before starting the projects and this website ?<br>
some of you have known me for quite some time because i played many online games, especially dress up games and ragnarok. i'm not going to get into this because i already have the gaming session, where you can check it out !<br>
i started with the internet very early, i was only 7 years old ( 2004 ). my mom always saw everything i did, so it was safe, don't worry LOL<br>
i used to play flash games, and i had msn, and a blog. everyone had blogs or personal websites on the internet, where they customized and posted all sorts of things. i was a kid so i was not good with those things, but i liked to post gifs with cute animals, lots of glitter and beautiful images that i found on other blogs and google.<br>
i didn't have social media at the time because i was very young and my mom wouldn't let me. i enjoyed visiting lots of websites with graphics and materials, beautiful blogs, and playing online games. my first online game was ragnarok, and my second, club penguin, if you wanna know.<br>
i only used the internet for 2 hours a day in the morning and i used this time to decorate my blog and play with my friends. it was so much fun and i have great memories of that time !<br>
i could have a social media ( orkut ) with 9 y/o, and i continued just posting cute graphics with lots of glitter, because it's just so adorable !<br>
i also knew several forums at that time, and began to communicate with people all over the world. my english was obviously horrible, but i used the google translator to help me. i never posted any real information or photo because i was taught that this is dangerous.<br>
i did several blogs, which were improving the quality of content and the layouts were becoming cuter. in 2006, i did the <a id="linkbjinho" data-target="spoiler1" class="btn-spoiler">first layout</a> that i really was very proud of !<br>
<center>

<div id="spoiler1" class="spoiler-area is-closed">
<!-- SPOILER AREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -->
<br>
<img width="300" height="auto" src="https://i.imgur.com/U1R9cm5.png"/>
<br>
</div><!-- SPOILER AREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -->
<style>
p { margin: 0; }
.spoiler-area {

}
.spoiler-area.is-closed { height: 0; overflow: hidden; padding: 10px 0 0; }
</style>
<script>
(function(){
    "use strict";
    var $btns = document.querySelectorAll('.btn-spoiler');
    function loop($els, cb) {
        var i = $els.length;
        while(i--) {
            cb($els[i]);
        }
    }
    loop($btns, function($btn){
        $btn.addEventListener("click", function(){
            var $spoiler = document.getElementById(this.getAttribute("data-target"));
            if( this.innerHTML === "first layout" ){
                this.innerHTML = "first layout ˣ";
                $spoiler.classList.remove("is-closed");
            } else {
                this.innerHTML = "first layout";
                $spoiler.classList.add("is-closed");
            }
        });

    });

}());
</script>


</center>
<br>
over time, the internet has been changing ... the blogs became unpopular, forums too, msn died, orkut died ... very sad, right ? ;-;<br>
i then looked for substitutes for the things i liked : i tried using facebook to replace orkut, but no one else cared about the glittery cute things and i was disappointed.<br>
i started using tumblr, which was well customizable and could fill the void that blogs left behind. it worked, even if it took a long time to find an aesthetic that would make me really happy, so i did several blogs until i got to my recent one ( it was during this time that i created the name middlepot ).<br>
my recent one, was done together with a friend of mine, who also made with me the not bad fb page, which should have the same aesthetics. but she and i had very different opinions of what we wanted to do and she'd post things that i didn't like, both on the tumblr and on the page ... it became a mess, and we ended up giving up doing it together. i'd like to talk more about it in another post, because it's a tricky subject ; ;<br>
anyway, i deleted her posts from tumblr and facebook, and then i got to what it is today : a safe and comfy place !<br>
the fb pages have similar content, which i get on tumblr. in this way, fb pages are extensions of my main tumblr, a way to bring content to people who don't know it.<br>
fb itself, i did not like to use as a social media. i also tried using instagram, but bad things happened and i gave up on it too. i'm used to the more open and customizable format the old internet had, so the tumblr was the place where i most adapted.<br>
to replace the forums, i found other places on the internet where i could communicate with various types of people, where i always remain anonymous as usual.<br>
to replace msn, which was the platform i always used to talk to my family and close friends, i decided to use line. line in my opinion resembles quite a lot of things, besides having super cute stickers and themes !!<br>
<br>
but in spite of having tumblr ( and fb pages ), other nice places on the internet & the cute line... i was still missing something, my little corner on internet, to be able to make layouts exactly as i imaginate & post every kind of things i want : a personal website !!<br>
so i did it, and here i am ♡ . * ･ ｡<br>
the 7 y/o me would be really proud of everything i'm doing right now. this website is really my favorite place on internet !<br>
it's all i wanted, here i can put together all the projects i do and all the content i like.<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this answers a few things about how i got here ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gQeft9B.gif"/><br>
and i wrote a lot, i hope it's not tiring to read ; ;<br>

i know i'm saying this all the time, but i'm really very impressed with the progress of this site, it's growing so fast !!<br>
it makes me extremely happy to know that things are going well here <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1GWPCfW.gif"/><br>
things in my life are complicated at the moment, so don't be surprised by my brief absences !<br>
i hope to start the store and improve some projects until the summer ( in december )<br>
about the frequency of blog posts, which are not exactly weekly, i'm trying to write posts as often as i get lots of good ideas for the q&a, but the plan is to keep the posts monthly, okay ? other pages, such as the status one, i will update more frequently.<br>
<br>
umm, as you know, i'm addicted to teddy bears. i honestly try to draw other things, but when i realize it, it's already a teddy bear. and also, bees, because i love bees !!<br>

<br>
for today's post, i will write about a subject that in fact, was the first request made here !<br>
since it's very complicated, this took a while to think about :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
age play, ddlg / cgl, there is a fine line between pedophilia and those kinks. how to identify dangerous situations, dangerous people, what's the limit ?<br>
i think the sex life between two adults, responsible for themselves, with consent, is something that allows things like kinks or lifestyles such as bdsm. any sub/dom relationship, have no relation whatsoever to incest or pedophilia. is something consented between two adults. anyway, it's a kink. in my opinion, kinks should in no way be publicly exposed, on the streets or on the internet, where children can see and be influenced. children can't have contact with these kind of things because it wouldn't be healthy.<br>
this unfortunately is something that has happened very often, and even worse, added to age play : ddlg / cgl has reached many minors and many adult pedophiles have had contact with these children through kink communities.<br>
these communities have become increasingly dangerous for minors, through the romanticization of pedophilia, child abuse and contact with kinks linked to childhood. even people who claim to be in a sfw ddlg / cgl community are not safe and are exposed to dangerous people as they use kink tags.<br>
communities of age regression that work hard to be a truly safe environment for people who don't use the agere as something sexual, are  anti ddlg. many people have gone against this kink, because of exposure to minors. it has become something horrible and manipulative.<br>
<br>
i agree that it is really very dangerous to associate childhood with sexuality, even if those involved are adults, and i firmly believe that kinks shouldn't be publicly exposed for children to see. neither of them.<br>
the only way to keep a kink safe and not harmful to anyone is without public exposure.<br>
<br>
　do i age regress ? am i part of a community ? am i in a relationship with a "caregiver" ?<br>
<br>
　❣ well, i don't think i really age regress, but i like doing some activities like coloring and making pillowforts... because it's just fun ♡<br>
　❣ as i don't age regress, i am not part of any community. but i really like kidcore and age regression blogs, because they always make me feel so comfortable !<br>
　❣ and, my bf, who i always call bubu ( boo boo, in case you don't know how to pronounce ) is not my caregiver, not in the agere way at least. but he takes good care of me, since i'm very sensitive and i get anxious about complicated "adult stuff", he always helps me a lot, he always makes me feel safe and i love him so much !!! ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
before i finish here, i'd like to say something quick about melanie martinez. everyone knows that there is a direct connection with her and the children's exposure to the famous "daddy kink".<br>
first of all, i would like to say that i particularly really like her instrumentals. but, i think her videos and lyrics a bit... dangerous. some of them are ok, but her most famous songs deal with trauma issues in a not very respectful way, and that really bothers me. i feel uncomfortable about it.<br>
i don't know if she's personally into a kink, and i've never seen her directly exposing kinks to children, so i'm not "against her".<br>
however, i know she's friend of <a title="[ 
yungelita ]" id="linkbjinho">a person</a> who is completely disrespectful to children, who sexualises child abuse, necrophilia, suicide and many other things. i have nothing against melanie in particular, at least for today, but i think she shouldn't have contact with such toxic people.<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope i have made things clear, since this subject is so controversial, it's difficult to write about it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xwdYOki.gif"/><br>
if i said something wrong, please let me know !<br>
i'm open to suggestions, as always, so don't forget my email : <i>letters@middlepot.com</i><br>

the weather is surprisingly hot for an early spring, and even so i'm eating a lot of sweets...<br>
it usually happens on cold days <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7rt3skM.gif"/><br>
the heat makes me pretty lazy, so i'm having trouble keeping my tasks up to date ; ;<br>
i'm trying very hard <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bMpgCel.gif"/><br>
by the way, i'm glad now i can respond everyone properly on the chat !!<br>
hmm, i'll be here probably once a week ? i like to have a week routine and i would not be able to be available on that site every day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BP3dchU.gif"/><br>
<br>
so, here is a very short song that i didn't do recently, but i suddenly found on my things, and i'm so happy because i thought i had lost it forever !!<br>

<br>
now, after having been asked a lot about it in the past weeks, the time has finally come :<br>

self diagnosis. deductions based on internet searches are safe ?<br>
i am not against this kind of research, for it's necessary that we know ourselves to seek appropriate help. it is not safe to be silent about our problems.<br>
consulting a professional without being aware of what we feel may result in an uncertain diagnosis. professional help will only be complete with our help, too !<br>
but, it is very important to know that it's completely unsafe to get conclusions about our health without consulting professional help, especially at the time of medication. self medication is something extremely dangerous that can make our problems worse.<br>
<br>
talking about our mental health can be a good thing when it comes to interacting with people because they can hurt us unintentionally. we need to talk about it with people we interact with.<br>
on the internet it has become common for people to make dx lists, to try to stay safe.<br>
there is a serious controversy about this as lots of people use self dx to have the freedom to treat people rudely.<br>
mental illnesses are not justification for doing evil. mental illnesses that affect the personality and make a person have bad attitudes are very serious and should be treated, you know ?<br>
people who use the name of illness to feel more special than others are extremely disrespectful, you should be careful when writing this kind of thing as a way of protection.<br>
<br>
personally, i think dx lists can be dangerous because people are bad and can use it against you.<br>people may think that you are pretending, or try to affect your weaknesses. i think this type of exposure requires caution.<br>
<br>
about me, i can't say i am not neurotypical, because i never had a dx, and i'd rather not do a self dx...
i am searching for it, because i think it's important.<br>
this is what i can say for now :<br>
<br>
ഒ　i am very very sensitive. i don't trust people easily and i don't have many friends, i never had. but i do have some people that i know i can trust, and they make me happy and safe around them. this makes me happy because i consider myself pretty much an introvert.<br>
<br>
ഒ　i do have problems with socializing, and i feel very anxious and i can't breath properly when i'm around lots of unknown people, specially if they are looking at me and if i'm alone. i feel better when i have someone i can really trust with me, but i usually don't put myself in unconfortable situations.<br>
<br>
ഒ　i had some bad experiences at home, i never had a good relationship with my father, he's not a good person. but my mom always made me feel better, she's a good person and i love her.<br>
<br>
ഒ　about some bad experiences i do not have clear memories. sometimes in bad situations, i lost consciousness. from time to time i have bad dreams about uncomfortable experiences. even though they happened many years ago, they always seem to be in my memory, and i hate it.<br>
<br>
i deal with these problems avoiding situations that make me uncomfortable.<br>
since i work and study at home and i have no contact with my father, i don't have much problems anymore.<br>
still, the fear is sometimes very strong because i feel i can by accident find him out there, or that people can force me to stay in uncomfortable situations, just by myself.<br>
i try to take care of myself the best i can. i hope to get a dx soon, because i feel it can help me to cope.
<br>
<br>
well, that's it !<br>
i wouldn't like to receive messages about the situations i mentioned, or deductions about my health, because i think it would be uncomfortable... thank you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/036DTpE.gif"/><br>
i hope this post has helped someone <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oG7ZHYe.gif"/><br>

i received an interesting question by email from a person who was wondering which tool i use to test html.<br>
well, i've always been used to testing html directly on the internet, because there were lots of sites with "html testers". after observing some, I was able to create my own "html tester" which consists of a very simple code !<br>
i realized that nowadays this is not very common, so, since it's very cute and functional, i think it would be nice to show you :<br>

it's basically a text box where you put the code, and when testing, it opens a popup with the result <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5cKIlPT.gif"/><br>
<br>
so let's get down to the today's subject, which i think some people can identify with :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
if you've been with me for some time on the internet, you must have realized that i rarely post selfies and even more rarely take pictures with other people.<br>
people who know me in person know the reasons, but i'd like to say here today because i think it might be interesting for some people who feel the same way !<br>
<br>
i don't like taking pictures, and i would not say insecurity it's my case, since i do not usually have problems with my appearance, i actually like it most of the time.<br>
it's kind of irrational, to be honest. i really don't like taking photos. i feel extremely uncomfortable with cameras, even with people looking at me, but with cameras it's especially uncomfortable, in a way that i can't explain ; ;<br>
when other people have a camera, i feel really bad and refuse to take pictures. people don't always respect that and keep insisting, but i flee from the situation whenever i can.<br>
the only person i don't feel so uncomfortable taking pictures of me is my mom, even because she always asks if she can, and doesn't show the pictures around without my permission.<br>
it doesn't mean that i don't like being with people, that i don't have friends, that i don't leave home, or anything like that. i just don't like taking pictures, and i wish people would respect that !!<br>
<br>
when i'm taking a picture myself, i don't feel so bad, and sometimes i feel in the mood. it's rare, but it happens. usually these moments happen the night before bed, or after waking up. i don't know why, i think i just feel comfy in my pajamas at home, and i pick up my phone at the moment ...<br>
yes, that's why i take pictures on pajamas.<br>
i actually have 2 or 3 of each pajama, and since idk, 2015, i took some pictures using the same ones LOL<br>
i'm always posting the pictures in different dates but some of them was taked on the same day. anyway, it was like, 5 different days of pictures i took with the SAME PAJAMAS<br>
it was not on purpose, of course. actually i have lots of pajamas, because i love pajamas. i change pajamas almost everyday... the thing is, i usualy have 2 or 3 of each because my mom is a semstress and buy fabric in big amont, and it's cute fabric, so i like to have identical pajamas because who cares ? i'm at home, i can use my favorites for longer this way, you know ? that's why my pajamas stay good even before years.<br>
<br>
i feel a little childish about these things, like, i don't prepare myself to take pictures and i have identical pajamas and i took lots of pictures with the same ones and don't even notice ;///;<br>
i hope it's not so weird, i have a theory : i think i take pictures with the same pajamas because i feel i look better with these, and when i'm with other ones i don't feel so ok to take pictures. it makes sense for me because i really like these, they are some of my favorites. unconsciously i feel super comfy with these and, take pictures.<br>
i think that's okay, it's hard for me to feel comfortable with cameras, if i was thinking so much about my clothes, hairstyle, makeup and everything, i would be so nervous ; ;<br>
<br>
hmnfg, maybe it's a little annoying to see similar photos all the time, and if it's really annoying, you can tell me !<br>
because about hairstyle, makeup, angles.. i'm not changing things. i don't work with my appearance or anything... i don't see why i would change my way to take pictures, you know ? it's just a little little thing for me, i don't take this serious, so please don't take this serious too. that's why i don't post selfies on the blog, or on social media, i would be really annoying to see the same face with same everything all the time, right ? i'm just still doing it because sooometimes i feel in the mood. i like to wear different clothes, to do hairstyles, using accessories, i'm indeed not really a fan of makeup, but none of that makes me want to take selfies, anyway. i do not like to show my face in photos, i feel shy, even when i feel cute.<br>
i want to take some pictures of my looks, clothes that i wear, but selfies, still rarely. i just don't feel like it.
so i'm still going to take selfies with pajamas, and sometimes the same ones, yep, the same hair too, and no makeup, because at least for now i feel good this way ! it's my way of feeling comfortable enough to take pictures from time to time ; ;<br>
<br>
i hope you understand !!<br>
and i hope it has not been so confused, because it's hard to express nonsense feelings <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Awsg3L5.gif"/><br>
that's it !<br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
in tumblr, it's very common to see specifications of what kind of aesthetics and content you post and what kind of people you accept interaction with. some of you are curious about my specifications and ask in my tumblr, which is related to my main facebook page too, since the aesthetics are similar.<br>
so here i am to clarify some things about the aesthetics that i post on my main tumblr, and what kind of blogs i usually follow and interact :<br>
<br>
♡　i usually follow blogs with kidcore, nostalgia, 2000s aesthetics, cleancore, cute graphics, vintage stuff, anything that is comfy and cute for me, because i make my blog a safe space.<br>
<br>
♡　my tumblr is not a kin blog nor an age regression blog and i am not part of any community, but i interact with age regression blogs from sfw communities. i don't usually interact or accept interactions with kink blogs, because these people can be dangerous.<br>
<br>
♡　sometimes, i follow trauma blogs. they have negative content from time to time and even nsfw content, but i don't usually interact with that kind of content, just the posts i consider related to what i'm feeling at the moment. trauma blogs sometimes make me feel comfortable and helps me deal with bad memories.<br>
<br>
♡　i interact and follow blogs with nudity, usually renaissance paintings, which i love so much ! i don't interact with porn blogs, and i usually block the ones i consider wrong.<br>
<br>
♡　i consider my blog really sfw, unless you consider artistic nudity and some small bruises nsfw. in this case, i'm really really sorry, but i don't use tags, because it would be so stressful and time-consuming for me. so please be careful about body image, gifs, bruises, religious images, medicine, bugs, dolls and other triggers. everything i've quoted is posted cautiously and infrequently + my blog is drama-free !<br>
<br>
<br>
i think this is enough to clarify your doubts !<br>
about self diagnostic, kinks and other controversial issues, i'll talk about it in the near future.<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this post has been helpful in some way <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QxtEqX4.gif"/><br>
see you next week !<br>

i'm extremely happy with the progress of this site, you seem to be enjoying it a lot ; ;<br>
as you seem to be still exploring the site, new content will be added to the pages gradually.<br>
at the moment i'm dealing with the shy bunny store preparations ! <img src="http://i.imgur.com/gmXpcA2.gif"/><br>
many items are being made, but i want them to be a surprise so i'll keep it a secret for now. after the store's announcement, new items will always be shown here !<br>
by the way, i'm really sorry for the store being only available to my country. this is because export rates are too high to the point of making sales nearly impossible <img width="15px" height="auto" src="http://i.imgur.com/kYbRfZV.gif"/><br>
in the future i promise that i will find a solution to this problem, as i intend to bring my items to you all !<br>
<br>
so, i think it would be nice to let you know that i've changed the layout of my <a href="http://dulci-chu.tumblr.com" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">main tumblr</a> !<br>
take a look :<br>

did you like it ?<br>
since we are talking about this project, there is something very important that i would like to answer in this post !<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
why do i use the word "loli" ?<br>
i feel it's very important to talk about the meanings of that word, and also of "nymph". it has become a taboo to use these words, and since ever, the lolita (ロリータ) fashion has been bothered by the other meanings of that word.<br>
recently, things like "nymphet aesthetic" are popping up. where do these words come from ?<br>
are these things connected ?<br>
<br>
so, beginning with loli, which is the abbreviation for lolita :<br>
it is impossible to know where the word lolita really came from. well before Nabokov, even Lewis Carrol already used that word.<br>
some people say it's just a nickname for lola, and that's it. it's a name, indeed.<br>
but not just a name, it has become a word full of meanings.<br>
i was able to gather 3 main meanings for this word, which can clarify some things for you all :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　loli/ta : a cute little girl, pure and innocent. this meaning has absolutely no sexual connotation. it's the meaning i use to describe adorable little girls. it's very probably the meaning that was the basis for lolita (ロリータ) fashion, although it is not intended for little girls, the silhouette is based on the clothes of little girls of the Victorian and Rococo eras, especially in some sub-styles, like the sweet loli.<br>
　Ⅱ.　loli/ta : a girl who looks younger than she really is, like a little girl, in appearance, or personality. this meaning was sometimes used in age regression and gave rise to a type of fashion related to age regression. however, despite being an adjective without sexual connotation, it is often used sexually in the pornographic industry and among kinksters. because of this, became a dangerous term and stopped being used in safe communities.<br>
related to this meaning, there is also :<br>
　　　　　lolicon / lolita complex : a person who is attracted to girls who look like little girls. obviously this is very questionable, but not necessarily linked to pedophilia. not yet.<br>
　Ⅲ.　loli/ta : a little girl, prepubescent or adolescent girl who is attractive and sexually responsive, sexually precocious. now, that meaning, is what really makes it all so dark. and related :<br>
　　　　　lolicon / lolita complex : a person who is attracted to little girls. basically, a pedophile.<br>
<br>
<b>important :</b> i don't know the origins of the word "shota", but it's the equivalent for boys, in all cases above.<br>
<br><br>
now, the word nymph, which is the abbreviation for nymphet :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　nymph/et : mythological creatures, close to the fairies. conceived of as beautiful maidens inhabiting the sea, rivers, woods, trees, mountains, meadows, and frequently mentioned as attending a superior deity. this meaning has no sexual connotation.<br>
　Ⅱ.　nymph/et : a beautiful or graceful young woman, a maiden, or a marriageable young woman.<br>
　Ⅲ.　nymph/et : an attractive and sexually mature young girl. due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women freely and without care, the term is often related to women who are perceived as behaving similarly. related, there's the term nymphomania that was created by modern psychology as referring to a "desire to engage in human sexual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant", nymphomaniac being the person suffering from such a disorder. in this case, the term "faunlet" is the equivalent for boys.<br>
<br><br>
so, as you can see, those words can be used without sexual connotation, but because of the other meanings, they become rather dangerous words. it is not safe to use them as tags for example, as they may attract bad people. you must be careful when using these terms, but it is possible, and it is not wrong. please, be careful ! <img src="http://i.imgur.com/oGcmE1L.gif"/><br><br>
and as you already must be thinking, yes, there are some similar stuff and related subjects that i will talk about in future posts, because they are also very important :<br>
　ddlg, age play & melanie martinez ;<br>
　serial killer worshiping & nicole dollanganger ;<br>
　self-diagnostic & trauma blogs ...<br><br>
( don't worry, i'm not going to be mean to anyone here, these are just interesting topics to talk about )
<br><br>
that's it !<br>
i hope you enjoyed this post <img src="http://i.imgur.com/dsfjv9n.gif"/><br>

<br>
hiii fluffies <img src="http://i.imgur.com/4G4Nwoa.gif"/><br>
middlepot.com is finally active, after a long year of preparation ; ;<br>
obviously this is too long time for creating such a simple layout, but the biggest problem was the college, which took up a lot of my time <img src="http://i.imgur.com/r02Ljqm.gif"/><br>
you are probably here because of my projects, where i shared this brand new website !!<br>
this layout was inspired by sites from the 2000s that i liked to visit, did you like it ?<br>
i'm going to change it from time to time !<br>
don't forget to look every little corner here, because there are so many pages !<br>
i want to create more interactive content in the future because i love web design and interactive websites. i have lots of plans !<br>
i want to make this site useful and fun for everyone, so please don't forget to leave your opinions and suggestions in the chat.<br>
<br>
hm, the projects are up to date, but the portfolio is not making me very happy.<br>
it was great to create one because i could see how i need to improve on things that i'm interested in doing <img src="http://i.imgur.com/9ZdvfHg.gif"/><br>
it's hard to focus on so many things, but i like to fill my time doing nice stuff !<br>
i will be updating the projects every week, but i will tell you all the updates here in this blog.<br>
by the way, i'll post a little thing riiiiiight now :<br>

hmnfg i have not done much of painting ;///;<br>
and it's been a long time since you saw a drawing i painted, right ?<br>
but now you will have many new things to see on this site !<br>
i'm so excited !!!!! <img src="http://i.imgur.com/k1JSTp1.gif"/><br>
<br><br>
so, let's talk about something very important, which are the rules of the chat :<br>
・ i use a tiny image as avatar for quick identification. you shouldn't use an avatar, because it would be confusing for everyone. if you want to link images please post in imgur.com and put the link properly, according to the "help" ;<br>
・ it is preferable not to use personal links because you may be blocked by spam. in fact, avoid anything that can be identified as spam, be as clean as possible ;<br>
・ please use clear language and do not speak in languages ​​other than english for a long conversation. i will answer, but predictably use english ;<br>
・ you can ask questions about what you want, and i will select every week an interesting and complex topic to answer in a q&a, because i like to discuss interesting subjects with you, and mainly clarify any doubts ;<br>
・ i'll block who pretend to be someone else ( i can see your ip ), who post nsfw content without warning and who say extremely rude and uncomfortable things ;<br>
・ this chat doesn't have the capacity to receive messages in large quantity, which is good, because i like to read everything and respond appropriately. if your message is not sent, you can try again at another time or send me an email ( letters@middlepot.com )<br>
<br><br>
for now, that's it !<br>
see you in the next post, with the first q&a.<br>
