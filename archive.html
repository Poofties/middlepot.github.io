hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZhgJgb8.gif"/><br>
i'm so excited ♡ !!!<br>
i'm finally ready to start my online store, shy bunny <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FYD71ij.gif"/><br>
i took pictures of all the items and i will post them in the next days !<br>
i'm going to do disclosure on my main fb page, which has similar aesthetics, and i also plan to make a giveaway.<br>
unfortunately, for now, this store only works for brazil, but i can deliver small items to other places if anyone has an interest. just contact me ♡<br>
i'm organizing everything the best i can <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dy3FvOr.gif"/><br>
<br>
so.. there are lots of political issues going on because of the elections here ; ;<br>
very stressful <img src="https://i.imgur.com/b44NCpX.gif"/><br>
i would like to make it clear that i don't like to give opinions on politics, economics or any subjects that i don't have proper knowledge to write about.<br>
i know it is important, but i don't feel comfortable posting opinions on subjects that i have not studied properly, i hope you understand !!<br>
( i'll add this to the faq )<br>
<br>
going back to the fun subject, i plan to post lots of cute crafts from now on !!<br>
i'm very happy about this, since it is something as important to me as my digital works.<br>
lately i've been pretty excited about trying different aesthetics for decoration, i'm always saving new material and i get inspired easily !<br>
i always have real strong tendencies for decorating everything with my main aesthetic ( because it always warms my heart right away ), but i believe my secondary aesthetics also represent important parts of who i am. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vVXYiJQ.gif"/><br>
i think they deserve some love too ♡<br>
i'm having lots of fun trying new color combinations, different textures... i feel that i'm improving a lot.<br>
today i'm going to show you a very nice chubby teddy bear, that will be in the store :<br>

isn't he adorable ♡ ?<br>
i just feel like squeezing him and giving him lots of kisses <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1DEhCyG.gif"/><br>
<br>
i also have something today that i've been forgetting to do for a long time ( i'm sorry /// )<br>
i recorded an audio in portuguese, with the story of the "pink little bug", that i wrote !<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
it's so much more comfortable to record in portuguese, really...<br>
i think it's a good story for before bed, what do you think ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bSzCqHQ.gif"/><br>
<br>
i would also like to post here a simple drawing that i painted.<br>
it's really nothing special, i was just bored, but i think it's cute and nostalgic <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2UJaqr0.gif"/><br>

do you also think painting is relaxing ?<br>
i absolutely love painting ♡<br>
<br>
in this post i have an important thing to talk with you, besides the main q&a subject.<br>
i want to talk about why i gave up using the feedback buttons on my website, as well as the hit counter !<br>
( yes, a lot of text lately, i hope it's not a problem ; ; )<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ⅰഒ<br>
since i wrote my "honest post" to you i reflected a lot about my attitudes. whenever i write something i do it initially to improve myself. i changed the way i treat my photos, i felt the need to clarify a lot of confusing things for you about personality and behavior that might be useful.. but i still felt very upset about the numbers on that site.<br>
i decided a few days ago that i want to stop using the feedback buttons as well as the hit counter. i've never really liked the idea of ​​exposed numbers because people always take them too seriously, above the quality of content... they really think that numbers represent something important when in fact it's not realistic or impartial ; ;<br>
i started using them because i liked to have feedback, but i think it turned out to be something not very relevant at some point... i'm not devaluing your clicks, but i prefer feedbacks with constructive words, tips and opinions, not just one approval or disapproval number. this has not really helped me improve, it's nothing compared to the messages i get. people are not numbers, they are individuals with real and important opinions and feelings. i want real opinions.<br>
to be honest, i was very happy to see the numbers growing, but i know that they don't represent much of anything other than the site is growing in visits ( which is good, but overvalued ). the numbers are mostly positive, and i feel extremely happy about it, but it's definitely exaggerated. reading true and honest messages from the visitors proved infinitely more enriching for me, even the shorter messages were written by someone who really wanted to give their opinion.<br>
social media have created this need for big numbers in people and even after partially abandoning social media altogether i have tried to use the feedback button system in my favor here, and it was quite useful at first, but i feel that i don't have more reasons to keep it here than to praise a false reputation for my image on the internet. i'm just a normal person doing my best, just like any other producer on any other website. i reflected a lot on this and people treating me differently because of numbers is not something that i value and i don't think is good for me or the visitors. the race for numbers and fame is not the kind of thing i'd be proud to encourage on my site ( or anywhere else, but unfortunately that's not always an option ).<br>
i kept the numbers exposed despite not approving their overvaluation because i believed it could bring public ; maybe people could took me more seriously if i had big numbers ? maybe they could allow themselves to look at the site more easily if they saw this "seal of approval" from previous visitors ?<br>
... but is it really worth blinding people with such superficial information and then saying it's not important ?<br>
i have come to the conclusion that i must be an example and show that appreciation of numbers is not healthy or productive.<br>
i felt free from this race for numbers as i moved away from social media, and i discovered over time that frequent visitors of my site are not here either by the numbers, but by the content, just as they are on other interesting sites and blogs of the internet. it definitely warms my heart to know that neatly my work honestly attracts so many people ♡<br>
so, i removed the feedback buttons from all the pages of the site ( except, of course, from the archives ) and made some changes to the layouts ( because i'm inspired ). i removed the hit counter from the index, although i still know how many ips visits my site, this is more for technical information. i'm going to increase the frequency with which the chat is open, so i decided to keep only one of them, moving the messages and smilies from the look book chat to the main chat, so i can have more control over it. consider these changes as a purification, it's extremely invigorating to be free of ego needs and social fears ~<br>
i hope hiding the numbers and keeping the written feedback in evidence is more productive for me and for you ! i wish from the bottom of my heart that you participate more avidly in this site, and not in the form of numbers, but as wonderful and real angels, which is what you are to me. ♡<br>
( remembering that i love exchanging long emails and letters, so be sure to get in touch with me at letters@middlepot.com if you want to talk to me )<br>
<br>
<br>
　ⅱഒ<br>
this subject is not so questioned but some people are curious to know what religion i have, since i occasionally write things that seem kinda religious..<br>
basically, i'm a paganist ! i do not consider myself anything more than that. i am a daughter of mother nature ; nature is my god and goddess, it's everything to me. nature guides me in all difficult times and has always helped me to make the right decisions, nature makes me feel at home wherever i am, it is because of her that i'm learning to see beauty in all things and to value the things that really matter and that make me happy. following my role in nature is my dream and guiding others to happiness & comfort is my passion ♡ !<br>
i often thank nature for everything i am blessed to enjoy in the most unexpected moments. i make prayers to bring good energies to the ones i love. i feel a lot of motherhood in nature and so i usually refer to it in a feminine way, but nature also has paternity depending on the moment so referring in a masculine way can happen. i have always been very attached to nature and mythology has always been a very great interest, i have always believed from the bottom of my heart in magic and in the magical beings who secretly play their role in nature & i utterly love to make offerings for these beings who take care of me and of whom i love. i also greatly appreciate sympathies and rituals that bring good energies and help us connect with nature. i usually do these things from my heart, instinctively, so i'm not part of communities or specific religion within paganism, although reading about these things is something i absolutely love doing.<br>
i always feel a very strong bond with fairies, angels and rabbits. i believe there are some particularities of my being that are the same as theirs, so i identify a lot even though i am a human. the role of the fairies in nature, the protective wings of the angels, the purity and maternity of the rabbits... these are virtues that i long for ♡ !<br>
i believe in faith as much as in fate. in my view, both are forces that work in our lives. when fate is absolute and yet your faith goes beyond limits, that's how miracles happen. i believe that the destiny is something that has no relation to us and where is our luck, as long as faith is composed of energies that make up our essence ; so we can also mess up our luck with negative thoughts, it's important to be careful with our feelings.<br>
i unhesitatingly believe in afterlifes, i don't have a clear vision of what it is, but i believe it is certainly something very fruitful for our soul, full of new opportunities ! i also believe in other types of lives simultaneously happening, in secret from us ( other realities and other worlds, like our dream world ).<br>
lastly, i would like to comment that i believe that all religions and personal beliefs of each person are important and that if the person is being guided to be better each day, they are certainly following the right path. i accept with all my heart any prayer and good blessings that anyone sends me. i love feeling connected in peace with other people so i love all kinds of expressions of affection, religious or not ♡<br>

aaa ♡ i have good news, and some updates !!<br>
i got a new camera, i'm so excited, i already took some beautiful pictures <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j2HpytF.gif"/><br>
i used to take pictures with my old phone or my mom's camera, which is good, but it was not always possible, so it kept me from taking pictures of some specific things like some of my crafts and.. well, myself.<br>
because of that, my pictures were usually inconsistent quality and it bothered me a lot ; ;<br>
i felt insecure and confused about posting my pics so many were randomly posted on my tumblr or facebook pages ///<br>
so now, i decided to organize my folders and just kept the beautiful, good quality pics. i deleted a lot of old stuff and even updated the look book page, the "about" pic and the portfolio.<br>
i decided to just make one session for my pictures in the look book and make them temporary ( i usually get tired of looking at old photos at some point so i know they will be deleted sometime ).<br>
this session will be for pictures of myself in general, because i don't really take pics of my looks or my face often, but more "specific" pics. i never knew where to post these here, so now i have a place.<br>
some old pics will be reposted from time to time, so i will not specify dates !<br>
i still don't think i'll post selfies often anyway, and i'll keep taking pictures with pajamas and nightgowns, because as i've said before, it's how i usually feel comfortable. also, i probably will not stop posting some pics anonymously out there.. i'm very shy, sorry ///<br>
i still have lots of updates to do about it + i'll post my crafts more often, so stay tuned ♡ !<br>
<br>
as you may have noticed, i also made some changes to my inactive accounts.<br>
i deleted my already inactive 8tracks acc, i had not deleted until today because i used to listen to some playlists there, but the site changes completely prevented me from doing this and i was annoyed.. there was no reason to continue there, since i couldn't even listen to my own playlists... <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fx1iziF.gif"/><br>
i also updated some images and erased some unnecessary posts in my facebook profile. i still keep it to keep in touch with some people over there + manage the pages.<br>
about the instagram account i decided to clean it completely and change everything, including the name. i did this because looking at the the old pictures were making me uncomfortable, they were not very good. also, i was getting many messages from confused people with my absence. i'll keep the acc because i want to keep in touch with some people, besides i always see very beautiful content there !<br>
i hope these changes haven't been uncomfortable for anyone, i just like to keep things organized ///<br>
<br>
now, i have a ( kinda old ) sketch that i painted recently :<br>

<br><br>
do you like when i post papercrafts here ?<br>
i plan to post more crafts in future posts.<br>
<br>
so today what's going to be double !<br>
the first text is about something i felt the need to talk about but that is not reeeally a subject : about my arguments in my texts in general.<br>
then i also wrote about a second subject : immigration. this topic seems to be "feared" by some people nowadays, but i think it's relevant to talk about it because it's in some way a reality in my life and will also include information about my future plans that you were curious about, so let's just get into it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j9db2cK.gif"/><br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ⅰ.<br>
people who read my huge texts here may notice that my arguments for all subjects have some patterns, i might say, characteristic of me.<br>
i always explain my reasonings to the conclusions, opinions, and "solutions to problems" that i arrive at ; but this doesn't seem to be clear enough to explain why i always think in a specific way and come up with texts that are so deep, sentimental and at the same time logical.<br>
the thing is exactly that ! i take into consideration all the parts that make up who i am. i am a human being who has rationality to be able to reflect on things and observe situations with an "impartial", rational and logical perception ; but i also have feelings, which are what guide me to questioning things and wanting to be happy, helping me and helping those i love, by getting answers to problems. despite having the sentimental side clearly stronger than the rational one, i strive to balance both when thinking about things and also to write my texts, so that i can get more consistent and useful answers. i don't always get it right because i have hormones that affect my cognitive ability from time to time, i'm an animal ( female, which makes me on the other hand get particular facility in other things, which i also try to make the most of ) but i only write my texts when i am in the mood to reach balanced conclusions.<br>
i think what makes the difference in my arguments to most people is that although i know that i am not the most mature and experienced person, not having much knowledge in specific areas, i always look for answers within myself and in the nature, which is what inevitably controls us. we are all composed of mind, body and soul ; our mind carry the ability to rationalize, our body carry feelings and instincts, our soul carry our pure essence. people usually focus on the part they are most comfortable using and form arguments based on that particular part, but that causes problems ; ;<br>
if you just focus on the mind you will make arguments that are insensitive, extreme and that will not bring happiness ; if you focus on the feelings you will make arguments that will not be useful, perhaps childish and very melancholy ; if you focus on the instincts you will make primitive and inconsistent arguments ; if you focus on the soul you will make arguments that are usually religious and too abstract to be understood. what i strive to do is to use the feelings ( which are my strength ) to guide me through the questions, then use all the other parts to form my arguments and respond to the problems consistently and clearly. my arguments are gentle and soft, natural, extremely sincere and even without having great academic background it's not just "all over the place". it's always thought to bring me happy and working responses, even though we are animals and nature is neutral, we can understand and work with it if we use all the parts that make us up properly.<br>
i know that my texts are focused on being personal and may not work for many people because they have opinions of their own, and i always encourage you to reflect personally to find your own answers. anyway, i think my way to get to the arguments in a balanced way is a healthy practice and i recommend it to everyone ♡ !<br>
i'm utterly happy to know that you like to read what i write, since it's something that comes from my heart ( and everything else ).<br>
<br>
<br>
　ⅱ.<br>
this is a complex subject and currently controversial so i'll start by explaining my point of view before talking about my personal experience :<br>
animals evolve over time to adapt to the places where they live, animals have always immigrated ( intentionally or unintentionally ) to the entire planet and this gives us the variety of species breeds we see today. with humans it was not different, our different races and physical types exist because we are animals that had to adapt evolving in the past, when this was very necessary ; not that it's no longer necessary since we continue in this process, but our small physical differences don't affect us in a very relevant way nowadays because we have been able to adapt our homes, clothes, food and everything necessary according to the local needs. this allows us to be able to survive anywhere in the world ( the more money, the more quality of life, if you choose a "difficult" place for you ).<br>
because of this, i completely support immigration, even though humans ( like all other animals ) have a "proper" place in the world according to their races and physical type, we don't need to follow these adaptations as long as we have the technology needed for our quality of life. i support that people can live wherever they want, out of necessity or for fun, we are all free to come and go on planet earth since we can have comfort through our efforts as a rational species ( for this reason, there are also no problems in being mixed nowadays ).<br>
my family and my descendants are made up of people from europe who came to brazil at a time when living there was very bad, while here was a wonderful and very comfortable place. it was the best choice for them at the time, and i don't think they did anything wrong because my family lived very well in the old days because of it. but a common problem especially in this type of drastic immigration ( from a completely different place to another ) is that future generations will find themselves in an increasingly worse situation of adaptation. my family doesn't have very good financial situation these days, and as i said earlier, if the place on earth is difficult for you to adapt, it takes more money to supply your needs.<br>
currently, living in brazil is not good for me or my family, we are not comfortable in many ways. our food is good but the weather is really a nuisance for me, although i absolutely loving the blue sky and the birds that live on my roof and sing every morning all year long, loving my mother tongue, loving many local foods and fruits ( that i'll take with me wherever i live ); the summers are getting more and more uncomfortable. but this is the "small" personal reason why i want to go back to europe ; i really want to form a family and the violence in my country is really something frighteningly common, besides the fact that the country is also not economically well. these are many problems that used to exist when my great great grandparents suffered when they decided to live in brazil. i want to go back to europe to give my children a good life and to be happier ♡ !<br>
fortunately, i can do that, and obviously i support that kind of attitude and i think immigration is great in many ways. they can cause problems for future generations, as it did for me, but this can be solved with more immigration and it is not something that has "ruined" my family or something, as some people often imagine ( ??? )<br>
i like brazil as well as i like anywhere else in the world, it is a beautiful and special place and i have obviously a special affection for this place has been where i was born and lived until today, but europe is where i want to live now and i think it's a good choice for being my "home" location, biologically speaking.<br>
besides, i would like to comment on other "immigration" details that relate to humans... i don't support raising animals or plants in very different places from their natural habitat unless it's done in a comfortable environment under carefully adaptation, and obviously without overloading the environment ( large-scale agriculture or animal breeding that are not locally appropriate affect the environment and are harmful to literally everyone, i utterly disapprove of these practices ).<br>
<br>
well, that's it, i hope i've expressed myself clearly !!<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rg8poHP.gif"/><br>
i realize how this website has grown since its creation and i am very proud of the progress <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3SNUoL5.gif"/><br>
i'm doing my best to bring frequent updates and useful content to you !!<br>
please ask me complex questions to write about, it's hard to think about subjects that seem relevant..<br>
i get many questions that would not really do a good q&a, you know ?<br>
<br>
you know that i have a routine page, i have schedules to do certain things and daily tasks, this helps me a lot to organize things, as well as my weekly listings and schedules.<br>
of course life doesn't always collaborate and we have to make adaptations, but it is great to have a base to know what to do and not waste time.<br>
so, i've been trying hard to spend less time on the internet lately !<br>
if i'm forced to do this i always find a way to do everything in a short time, but it is difficult to have discipline when i have free time ; ;<br>
some of my tasks require the internet, so i defined a period of 3 hours a day as the maaaaximum time on the internet, on those more complicated days ; but i usually spend 2 hours or even 1 hour and i'm very happy about it ♡ !<br>
it's a very important practice, especially for those who do many "quiet" activities like me, it is necessary to space these times to stretch, drink water, make snacks and take some air outside.<br>
in fact, i would like to clarify that i don't really wake up 6 am going to sleep 1 am, it would be torture.. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NtMNFpN.gif"/><br>
i just get up to watch the sunrise ( when it's possible, i really like doing it ), so i also eat a fruit and plan my day ; if it's very hot i like to take a shower to refresh, then i go back to sleep until 10 am !<br>
i just really wake up at 6 am if i need to and in that case i always go to bed before midnight.<br>
<br>
i was writing lots of letters lately and thinking.. sometimes i get a little annoyed with my handwriting because it's very... childish <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Clflx9p.gif"/><br>
i don't know how to explain, i don't think it's ugly, it's kinda cute ; but it's a little clumsy, small and "roundy", it's the same handwriting that i see in my old school notebooks !!<br>
if you have already exchanged letters with me or have already seen my handwriting fonts you will understand.<br>
( by the way, if you are interested in exchanging letters don't hesitate to contact me in the email because i love doing this ♡ )<br>
i really like calligraphy so i train a lot, i like to write in different letters to make decorated titles and "aesthetic" texts, but my natural handwriting really is childish and there's nothing i can do about it ; ;<br>
they say people's handwriting reflects their personality, i know everyone has a unique handwriting that is a "brand" of them and that's very special ♡<br>
but it is impossible not to envy people who have naturally mature and elegant handwriting ///<br>
well, i can "simulate" this if i really want to, but it's not the same since it inevitably doesn't suit me very much so i usually just prefer to be myself.<br>
<br>
enough of talking, today the post will have a super cute drawing that i painted ♡ !<br>

<br>
today's q&a is something sweet and positive for you ♡<br>

<br><br>
have you ever seen people who are so beautiful, kind and have a lovely aura that makes everyone feel comfortable and safe around ? it seems like a rare and precious personality trait, like this person knows nothing bad and lives in a beautiful and different reality.<br>
in fact, i have learned over time that this is a skill to be acquired with maturity. bad experiences don't influence who you really are and shouldn't make you have a heavy and sad aura. bad experiences happen for you to mature and to be able to avoid them in the future, as well as helping other people in a similar situation ; traumas are not part of you, all bad things you've been through, you've seen or just know that exist, none of that is part of you and none of that represents your reality.<br>
you should never become ignorant, keep yourself informed of the world situation and mold your opinions is very important to live healthy and safe ! however, it is extremely important to keep yourself pure despite all this. purity will give you a different aura and will make your reality, in fact, beautiful.<br>
don't let bad thoughts and memories affect you continuously ; boring and ugly things are a part of life and you really should deal with them properly and don't ignore them, but you should not make them a personal problem. on daily basis you should forget everything bad and only think of beautiful and pleasant things that you live, lived and would like to live : daydream, watch the sky, pick flowers, write love letters, wear perfume, put on pajamas all day, wear your favorite dress casually ! life has many opportunities for you to make it beautiful and create good memories for you to keep and share with others.<br>
surround yourself with beautiful things, embellish ugly things you don't like to look at, cherish people who love you & move away from people who are toxic to you. small details in your life can greatly help shaping your ability to be positive and emanate kindness and beauty ♡<br>
<br>
remember : the kinder you are, the more beautiful you become ( and that includes being kind to yourself )<br>

this is a very special month, since it's the 1 year anniversary of middlepot.com + i turn 21 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/adJshVZ.gif"/><br>
i wish i could express in words how much i love this place and how i love to post here ♡ !!<br>
it was definitely the best thing i've done to date and i plan to make it better and better for me and you fluffies, so don't hesitate to send me your opinions and tips <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4uVV3q3.gif"/><br>

the days are going very smoothly and i just baked marshmallows, so i'm a comfy girl <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gnlwVsb.gif"/><br>
i hope everything stays this way until saturday, which is my birthday, because i'll go on a date with my beloved bubu and i want it to be perfect ♡ ♡ ♡<br>

this post will be full of soft and cozy things, all in a similar aesthetic that i've been wanting to work with for some time, i recommend you eat something sweet to get into it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hq0iHtO.gif"/><br>

it's so fun to make these collages, i really want to do it often, if you support me ♡<br>

and talking about teddy bears, i had a sudden idea when i saw my png folder and realized that i had a lot of stuffed animals in there ( 56 specifically )<br>
i had to do something with them urgently, they can't just be homeless and all over the place <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dwoRLsQ.gif"/><br>

today i want to write some important tips to you who often feel dissociated and confused with your very existence.<br>
it is a very complicated subject, but i know what i'm going to say here is a good introduction to reflections and learning that you will have to follow on your own ; getting started is usually difficult so i'll say the method i chose to better understand myself, my passions and goals.<br>
will i really be able to help someone with these words ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gy3kOEy.gif"/><br>
i wish from the bottom of my heart !<br>

<br><br>
i know that the pursuit of self-knowledge is something that never ends, but i, being young, realize that young people usually seek to be special in some way, seeking individuality. the thing is that we are all different and have individualities already, if you don't know which ones you can't enjoy this right, you can't be yourself and improve, so you just become artificial and sad. adults also don't usually know who they are, they just let it go, it makes them more and more faded, which is extremely sad. feeling dissociated and not knowing who you are is a bad feeling and should not be taken to life, so i will try to help you by saying how i managed to understand who i really am and my individuality, i hope it can help some of you too !<br>
something that helped me a lot to understand who i am were the aesthetics. i know this is a very recent term and it may seem rather silly and superficial, but you can call it other things too, since it has always existed : style, spectrum, tendency, essence.. i like to call it aesthetics because i am quite visual, but you must understand that what i mean by that is the essence of who you are, represented through visuals, personality, lifestyle, passions and others.<br>
we are very stimulated seeing beautiful and wonderful things everywhere, aesthetics that we want for ourselves. the problem is that we can not be all things, although we have different moods and personal tastes, there are limits to who we can be ; when you go beyond these limits you feel dissociated and uncomfortable. only you can know who you really are and when you're not being yourself, so you must first learn to understand your feelings and not be carried away by the desires of being someone different, you are perfect being who you are, people are beautiful and perfect in different ways ( and only when they are being themselves ).<br>
you certainly have personal tastes and should not suppress them to fit into groups, your personal tastes help you a lot to understand your personal essence ( we don't really can choose to like things voluntarily, we just like it ). i discovered who i am separating my personal tastes : whenever i had to choose a color, a music, a food, a place, above all others, although i like lots of different things, i always had a specific preference , there was a clear pattern in these things, despite different moods. in this way, through experimentation, i was able to discover my favorite aesthetic. and i must say, you will not find yours coming from someone else, you will only find elements that will compose your personal aesthetic. aesthetics carry specific messages and feelings, so you must understand what you are looking for.<br>
it may seem confusing, but for example, i started by just liking cute, delicate, and feminine things ; within that there may be infinite variations, so i sometimes felt confused and uncomfortable with some cute things that did not really match me. "but i like cute stuff, what's the problem ??" i thought. the problem is that i am me, i am a person, people are complex. i began to realize that i felt artificial when trying to adhere some elements that didn't represent me ( despite being visually alike, carried different feelings ). gradually i separated the elements and composed some aesthetics that i really liked and i felt comfortable about it, until i discovered my ult fav one.<br>
i have a tip for you : always think about the adjectives that define things, these adjectives should complement and make sense to you, should be pleasant and make you feel good ( even the negative ones ). you must do this with all things, not just with visuals, since your essence is present in all the things that make up you.<br>
by understanding who you are, it will be much easier to self improve, you will be able to have healthier relationships and help people, you will have better self esteem, you will better understand your personality ( and therefore take better care of yourself as you will understand your limits ), you will be able to find hobbies, to find out what you want to do with your life, you will be happier and will continue to be free to enjoy things that "don't fit" your main aesthetic, since this is also part of your individuality and should not be denied. as i always say here, you must always seek purity.<br>
i would like to make it clear that you should think about yourself rather than what others feel about you or how other people "should" see you. only you can know yourself deeply and truthfully. people should see you as you really are, you must be yourself and you should not be a walking lie to please others, therefore you will not please anyone or even yourself ! lies are always bad.<br>
<br><br>
i hope my words are useful ///<br>

i've been feeling so in love these days ♡ !!!<br>
whenever i am i send endless messages of love and appreciation to everyone i admire, in addition to writing lots of poems and love letters to bubu ( my favorite person in the whole world, of course he deserves it )<br>
and in return i always get very heartwaming messages that make me blush <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0yHKPnX.gif"/><br>
if you feel like spreading love, always do it !<br>
don't keep compliments just for yourself, let who you love know how much you love them<br>
( if you're shy, do it anonymously, but always do it )<br>
<br>
so today i'm going to post here updates of the last two projects, because yes, i updated them all !<br>
and i intend to continue updating from time to time, but i will give myself some time to rest because i really worked hard doing all this <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aTV14Rn.gif"/><br>
for the soft collection i did a little "study" with a drawing of <i>umibenobochi</i>.<br>
the soft girl featured this time is 142 ♡<br>
i painted with pastels and added different types of paper and also a satin ribbon :<br>

i want today's q&a to be useful to some of you, although it is a personal reflection, i know it is also a subject not much thought and discussed, so i think it's good to share with you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ac6UGRe.gif"/><br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i think it's really important to write about it because it's something that has disturbed me all my life and i've always kept quiet about it because no one would take it seriously anyway.<br>
people live by money, they act as if money is everything in life. even if they pretend they don't, they always think of money in the first place ( of course, until they have real problems in their lives and money doesn't help ).<br>
ever since i was little i have always been bothered by the importance that all adults gives to money, but they have always told me " you will understand when you grow up ". well, i grew up, and reflecting a lot on what i want to do with my life, i definitely know that i do not want to live looking for money until my death.<br>
how important is money to our lives ? to begin with, we are living beings, so we must survive in the first place. to survive, we need food, water, shelter, medicine, cleaning products, clothes... nowadays it is also quite necessary to have electricity.<br>
secondly, we need to be happy, of course, because we have feelings and we think a lot about things, so we need to feel satisfied ! i believe that to be happy is a very personal thing, but in general we need to have peace in our hearts. this is not bought for money, of course. we need to feel comfortable and complete, the pursuit of this is different for each person. in general, we want the presence of people we love in our lives, and this may need money, but not so much, usually the longing is caused more by the lack of time or health of people. some people seek happiness through material goods, which may indeed be quite amusing, but should never be treated as essential because it is not. never. it's the silly, futile thing to expect to be happy, to be sad for the lack of material goods is totally meaningless if you think about it.<br>
sure, then to be happy it's not necessary to have much money but rather own knowledge and inner peace ; but we need money to survive. of course you can't just run away from money if you were born into society. if you live in a big city, you need to pay bills to have water, shelter and electricity, you need to go to the market to buy food and cleaning products, you have to spend money on medicines and hospitals, you have to buy clothes ! well, it is possible to avoid much of this if you live in the countryside and can have water and food and even produce electricity, because we are intelligent human beings and we have nature in our favor, with effort we can enjoy it a lot. but you will still need money for other things.<br>
i know what i'm writing are obvious things, but people don't usually think about them, which makes them very confused about life and how money should be used and what it really is for. it exists to be exchanged for important things that we can not produce alone, that we need the help of other people. we can't do everything on our own, and so humans live collectively, to help each other and to fulfill our needs, so we can survive much longer and have time to be happy. or so it should be, of course. things go wrong when people forget what is important to them and what they want and like to do. people can not be happy because they think only of money and what they have been taught to do.<br>
to make money we need to help other people by doing something they want to pay for. there are many options for this, some are more stable and some less stable. there are many reasons for this, i do not know much about economics, politics or anything like that, but in my view one of the reasons is because some forms of work are extremely indirect, you are not helping anyone really, maybe even being a nuisance. this makes your job a bit pointless, so it's easily disposable and replaceable. people think of this part ( the job ) as super important to their lives and ironically treat it in the worst possible way : they think about what can make more money, neither what makes them happy nor other people happy. money should never be the focus of your life, since this job will be something that will occupy a good part of your life and should be something that helps other people, it should be something pleasurable, rewarding. you can choose from endless options of jobs, why choose to be a slave to money or have a purposeless and unstable work ? i just can't understand.<br>
obviously many things that we enjoy so so so much are things that are not so useful to others and do not give much money, so we call them hobbies. i would not recommend trying to make a hobbie-type your source of money to survive, as that would give you extreme instability in life and make you very frustrated not to have the work valued. some people can actually make it work, but to have the time and dedication to make it happen it is necessary to survive in that period. if you are supported by someone, you can do this, but it is indeed complicated. BUT it doesn't mean that you should stop with your hobbies or treat them as something small in any way, they are still important, just not your main job.<br>
thinking about all these things made me define what i want to do with my life ( the answer was the simplest, since these are things i always wanted to do, i just needed to figure out if this would work, of course ) : i definitely do not want to be a slave to money, i will never think of money as something to give life and happiness. i just want to do things that i like and i'm proud to do. that doesn't mean it will be easy, i'm going to have a lot of work and i'm going to try hard to make it work, but with a bright smile on my face !<br>
i want to live a little away from the city, because i want to plant and raise animals. i have several plans on this and i know it's rather complex, but i've been planning a lot for several years, since it's something i've always wanted to do since i was little. i can tell you the details about some things if you want, of course, only practice can teach me what this kind of life can offer me, but it's really what i want. and i never thought it was something that could give me money since i always grew up having my dreams devalued and being encouraged to work on boring things to have money. i'm glad i never took it seriously and i always followed my heart.<br>
i already told you that i want to have a cafe, right ? so, this is part of the whole thing, since it also involves food. i believe that selling food in general is quite stable and will be extremely enjoyable to me. the part where the cafe is also a store, is the part where my hobbies are included, since i do not want to abandon them !<br>
money, being something quite vague and used only to buy important things that help us survive and possibly have extra entertainment, is something that at the moment i am exclusively using with the intention of realizing my dreams and having a source of happy income and stability. in the future, i know that i will have money to also buy beautiful things and travel, but that will only be because i worked hard and made the right choices : i chose to follow my heart, to help people and to be happy.<br>
do not choose to live for the money, do not be sad because of money, never !!!<br>
<br><br>
i hope this helps you to reflect on your life choices and think about whether you are really choosing happiness.<br>
i know a lot of young people read my blog, so i really wish you were not influenced by the sad, greedy adults around you ; ;<br>
um and i'm sorry if i wrote too much unnecessarily ////<br>

what do you think ?<br>
i think it's lovely <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ChuJWcI.gif"/><br>
<br>
for today's q&a i decided to write about a rather controversial topic,,<br>
i, indeed, feel a bit of apprehension. but i believe you will understand my point of view <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xi8VIDT.gif"/><br>
( please consider that this is the way i feel comfortable about dealing with it within my lifestyle )<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
because of some things i've said before, people ask me about this : i'm not vegan, but i'm trying my best to be 100% cruelty-free !<br>
veganism is not just about diet but also about products and lifestyle. i am completely in favor of using only cruelty-free products, which are not tested on animals, anything that is not natural and causes suffering is something i completely repudiate. having a healthy and natural lifestyle is something that i try hard to have ! well, i support all that part of veganism about being cruelty-free, but not the part of the diet. it's something very personal, so please don't take it as a criticism, it's just what i believe.<br>
i'll start with the meat : i don't think eating meat is anything wrong, cruel or bad to do. it's a natural part of life and i see no problems about killing to feed. obviously, this goes a long way, since humans are not necessarily carnivorous, and we also have the rationality to avoid such things, but meat was ( and still is ) a very important part of the diet of most humans. not all people can really avoid the meat and replace it, it's very cultural and complicated. my biggest problem with meat is the cruelty involved in the process, animals that are bred only to die and live miserably, it makes me very sad and angry. a second problem are the hormones given to the animals so they grow up faster, it's extremely bizarre and disgusting, it does SO bad for the health of anyone !! for these reasons, i am seeking to limit myself to just eating meat from animals that have been properly reared, with a healthy, natural life, as was formerly the case. this is hard to find and also very expensive, but like i said, we do not need meat to survive anymore, so i think it's very plausible. i just can't eat meat from tortured animals like it was normal.<br>
now, about milk and milk products in general, there is a big controversy about whether milk is bad or good for people's health. milk is obviously the most important food for a baby, but that is breast milk. the milk of other animals is not really needed for us, but if eaten properly, it can be very healthy. the milk can not be consumed in large quantities, but i don't think that it does bad unless you have some intolerance or allergy ( which is quite common, but not everyone has ). for me, the biggest problem about milk is how animals are treated horribly and full of hormones, same problems as meat. so i have to really do a lot of research to find good sources.<br>
about eggs, it's a very important part of the human diet since ever, but of course, it can be replaced. however i have no problems with eggs, just with the treatment of animals, just like the above cases, i look for good sources.<br>
commenting briefly, wearing fur and animal hide is horrible when they kill animals only for the luxury of vain humans. the skin and leather removed from animals that were killed for food is not something i see problem ( although i have problem with rearing animals in most cases, as i said earlier ). the skin of animals that died in natural ways is something i have nothing against !<br>
finally, i want to comment on honey, which is somewhat controversial among people who adhere to veganism. i am not against honey or beekeeping, bees do not suffer in the process, it's quite the contrary, they live much better by having humans protecting them. they produce much more honey than they need, and using this extra honey is not wrong. the problem with beekeeping is that it should not be done all over the world, and it is. honeybees should not be living all over the world, but humans carried them everywhere, just for convenience. typical ignorant selfishness. the problem still is not for the bees but for other animals, other pollinators are extremely harmed by having their habitat invaded by bees that should not be there. different types of bees are natural from specific places. i support the breeding of bees in their proper habitats ( in reasonable quantities, obviously, the overpopulation of bees is not good anywhere ). this is not so difficult to find, since you can know the source of the honey you buy. depending on where you live, if it's one of the appropriate places, there may be local creators you can support ! research is the key for a good lifestyle.<br>
<br><br>
um, as usual, i didn't intend to write that much ; ;<br>
but i hope you understand my point ///<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9CA8vG4.gif"/><br>
many new things are coming soon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2417xmz.png"/><br>
as you may know, some of my projects have been standing for some time because of some important things i've been doing lately. i'm actually quite busy with these things, but i've been reflecting on all my projects and realized that i should not let them totally stand still for so long. they all exist for a reason and keeping them active would help me a lot to practice my skills in different areas, after all they were created to motivate me to study and always be using my creativity ! also, they have a story behind, i care for them.<br>
i always value my hobbies because they make me happy, even if i know i'm not so talented at everything i do, i think it's worth doing my best to keep doing it. i will continue updating all my projects even if it is with a lower frequency ; being occupied with other things is not a justification to abandon them ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/luE544t.gif"/><br>
i'm feeling pretty motivated so i'm certainly updating all my projects.<br>
<br>
some people liked it, so today i have again some little things that i have embroidered :<br>

so ?<br>
i think it's very cute <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PUJ4Ggb.gif"/><br>
<br>
maybe you have seen that i posted a new html stuff, an aesthetic virtual journal !!<br>
i had this idea randomly when i was doing collage. i love doing this and i always have several journals with different aesthetics, stationery is one of my big passions ! i also like to put pieces of fabric, ribbons, buttons, even beautiful packaging.<br>
i've always wanted to somehow do this digitally, but i have never really tried, until now. it's actually easy, and a lot of fun ♡ !!<br>
i took the opportunity to offer you some cute thematic materials that you can use for decoration, digitally or even printed. not all the stuff that i offer in these packs are mine, these are just things that i have saved here, so if anyone doesn't want their content to be included please let me know ///<br>
i intend to keep making new pages, so stay tuned <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sWD1PMF.gif"/><br>
the domain is literally cute ( cute.home.kg ) and i'll leave a backup file for every page i make :<br>

<br><br>
so.. this may seem like another personal q&a, but i consider it more as an important observation about how you see me and also other people.<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i would like to vent some things because i receive several messages and i know that although i am not of great influence, i still have responsibility with people who expect things from me and see me as an example in any aspect. it's natural that you overestimate me, since i'm on the internet and just post my best ; but it's important that i be modest & honest enough with you so this is not a problem and make you have the wrong idea about me ///<br>
everything i'll write here i hope you also remember when observing other people :<br>
i usually say my personal opinion on these q&a texts. this is important to note, because although i always hope to be helping someone to think about these issues, i never expect you to agree with what i say or assume as correct. is my opinion, my point of view, the way i thought to get where i am today. tomorrow i can change, and i hope so. if i change, i will tell you my new thoughts. you may have a completely different view of the things i write here and be happy in your own way, but at least for me it is always good to see other people's sincere opinions to refine mine. read my texts as an external opinion, think carefully about it and think about your own opinions.<br>
i am not perfect. that's obvious, but people tend to think girls on the internet are perfect. i can say that i always do my best and i work hard every day for this. i'm not super talented in most of the things i do and so i'm always studying and practicing. i post the best i do, even if not super good or important things, because i like to receive criticism. it helps me a lot to improve ! my own opinion can help me, since i'm a perfectionist, but sometimes we're just tired and let it go, you know. i can say that i am today the best and most perfect that i could be, within my experiences and reality. tomorrow i'll be better, and so on. if i have to be an example to someone, i want to be an example of motivation, because you should never copy others and try to be like them, you have to be yourselves and the best you can be in this way !<br>
i would also like to talk about my appearance, even though i rarely post pictures of myself, this is a serious topic, since the biggest negative influence that internet girls give others is their perfect ( super edited ) photos and the lack of integrity in saying they are not perfect in real life...<br>
so, about me, being quite honest, i think i am pretty. other people have always said that i am pretty, but that doesn't seem true until i clear my mind ; i like almost everything about my appearance, what took time to happen, since i have my insecurities as well. i still have some things about myself that i would like to improve, and i intend to do so in the future. although i take great care of my skin, it is very sensitive and i usually have allergies from time to time, so i have some spots that i could not repair on my own. there are procedures to help with this, but they are a little expensive, so at the moment i just accepted, these are marks of difficulties that my skin has gone through, that's okay. and i'm very lucky because all the skin that is exposed, like my face, has no marks, so it's something that only those who know me more intimately have already seen ; ;<br>
obviously, anyway, my skin may look like porcelain in the pictures, but in real life it's normal skin, i have pores, you know.. i take care of it a lot and i have to clean and moisturize every day to keep it nice, just like everyone else ! i do not wear makeup often and i always use sunscreen, so i think this helps a lot. i can talk more about skin care in another post, as well as about makeup i use.<br>
my pictures are pretty blurry and have filters, not only because my camera is really bad, but also because i like to make the pictures a little blurry to soften everything and to use filters to adjust the lighting. i do it with all the pictures, not just those of my face, if you notice. when i have a better camera, i can try to take more natural pictures, i would like to try !<br>
last, but not less important, numbers : numbers are not something you should ever take as a basis for success, numbers are extremely inconsistent and are not always real people. even the numbers you can see on my website may seem like a big deal, but they are not consistent as well, since they count the same ips over and over again. and this a problem that exists even on large websites, or do you really think millions, billions of people watched the same video as you ? then, you should only consider real people, always. and a large amount of public is not always something to be proud of, since many people who are not good, lie a lot & are toxic, have many fans. always think of those people who send you sincere, truthful messages that not only praise you but also want you to improve as a person. these messages are what i always consider important and i love receiving them ! i get sad about receiving rude messages, especially when they don't make sense, but even some rude messages can help me mature and improve. i always ask people to be kind to each other, but if i made you angry for any reason, do not hesitate to tell me the reasons, because i don't want to hurt anyone, i am always open to improving and learning new things. i'm no better than neither of you, i'm just better than myself every passing day. we're all here to help each other, not to act superior !!<br>
never support people who make you intentionally feel inferior and less capable than them, who make you feel ugly and useless. you can always be a great person, smart, mature, beautiful, you have the right to have hobbies ( even if you're not so talented right now ) ; you can be perfect, within your reality. your personality may not be 100% ideal, but you're sure to find the balance so this will not get in the way of you improving and being a good person. be pure, be yourself, always ♡<br>
( oh, and, it's okay to feel sad and negative sometimes, making mistakes is normal, we just have to work hard not to keep it that way )<br>
<br><br>
did my huge text help motivate you in any way ? i hope so <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3gkUBIB.gif"/><br>

have you noticed, over there ? that's right, ssl !!<br>
i know this is kinda silly, but i was actually thinking about getting "https" on my website for a while.<br>
i'm quite proud, do you remember about the post where i said "i probably will not be able to make all the necessary adaptations or change all links everywhere" ?<br>
it took some time, but i did it ♡ !!!<br>
( and also with all the other domains with my html stuff )<br>
<br>
i'd like to talk a little bit about my projects that are a little stuck,,<br>
at the moment i'm working hard on a game with bubu !<br>
he got the main idea, i created the characters and i'm now writing the whole script ( which takes a while ) <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gVFT5Yh.gif"/><br>
he will deal with the programming, i don't think i will draw the concepts, but we are still planning this part.<br>
we've had lots of ideas for games together and we've finally gotten started with one of them, i'm super excited !!!!!<br>
i will not tell you about what it is yet, but you will know soon !<br>
oh, and i didn't forget the shy bunny store, of course. i just had financial problems these times ; ;<br>
things are normalizing and i'm saving money again to start the shop and for all my future plans. i'm working hard the best i can !<br>
my dream is to have a ( physical ) stationery store, that also sells crafts, accessories, clothes, plushies and all things cute,,, that is also a cafe ♡ !! ( of course things will be separate but the thing is that it's the same establishment )<br>
i have been practicing a lot of cooking and baking lately <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AsZa0Mn.gif"/><br>
it will be super comfy and cute, i have so many ideas for decoration and everything. i know that i will be able to realize this dream, even if it takes time, i will do my best for the future !! i always feel so happy to work with things that are beautiful and make people feel happy, it's literally the best thing in the world for me.<br>
life is a surprise pot and we should never stop dreaming about what will come out of it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xl53EkP.gif"/><br>
<br>
recently i've gone back to drawing some little things in ms paint and i did some cute things that i liked a lot !<br>
here i am going to show you a drawing of myself that just happened :<br>

yes this post is going to be a bit long, but today the q&a will be double..<br>
i want to stop writing many personal topics in a row so i'll just answer both already ; ;<br>
the first one is a curiosity about my name, the second one is something important. both will be in the faq !<br>

melissa is my name. i really like my name, but i don't use it on the internet because it would be difficult to find me, you know. melissa is the name of a plant, the lemon balm. it is common for people to use this plant to make tea and for medicinal purposes. it has very small, white and delicate flowers. the meaning of this name is literally "honeybee", which makes people give some interesting interpretations to it. some people gave me the nickname "mel" ( which means literally honey ), but they usually call me melissa.
<br>
<br>
　｡ ･ * . ♡ 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑡
<br>
this is actually more a surname than a name, but i use it as a nickname on the internet, as well as some variations of it ( mimi, midpot, mimipot ). it's not a real surname, i discovered it in a dream. at the time i was thinking of a nickname to use on the internet and i had just created the "crwel friends" project, so i was thinking about many things and characters, especially potatoes. i used the nickname "poteto" from time to time, because of that. one day i dreamed about potatoes and many other confusing things, including a very fat and giant cat that called me "melissa middlepot". he told me "you're bigger than your potato friends, but there are still bigger potatoes, believe me", even though i was not really a potato. i know it's weird, but the dream was in portuguese, except for the surname "middlepot", so it's a bit hard to explain LOL. well, i woke up really thinking that middlepot was good, it sounds like some english surnames. so, yes, i believe that "pot" is from "potato". be honest, "middlepot" is pretty cute, isn't it ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
i have been asked a few times to make lives here on the internet, but it's not so often, the most common is that people ask me to do things personally, publicly.<br>
for example, i studied cello for a few years in a music conservatory. i had no problems playing cello for one person, but i was always invited to try to participate in concerts. i never wanted this, but i felt bad because it was something that everyone expected of me, "for my evolution". why couldn't i evolve without hundreds of people staring at me ?<br>
when i was a child i was always asked if i would like to be a model, but i always denied it because i didn't like the idea, i was never the kind of person who liked to receive attention from many people. i always felt suffocated and uncomfortable in being in the presence of many people, especially when they were all looking at me.. very horrible for me, really.<br>
i even denied taking ballet classes as a child because i was afraid to participate in live performances. i knew i would be obligated, i didn't want that. however, i wanted to dance, so i ended up training alone at home and ended up enjuring my foot because of excessive exertion on the fingers. maybe i can never dance ballet because of it. i could have taken classes right, but they didn't give me the opportunity. they only talked about "when i would dance on a stage". i know no one wanted my bad, but it still hurts.<br>
at school and college i was forced to present projects in front of the whole class, it is common to do this at school. this has always been very traumatic for me, although i always strive to be all right. i went through bad times with these uncomfortable situations, i tried to force myself to change and feel confident, but that was not really the problem. even when i did everything perfectly right, i was not nervous, i didn't say anything wrong... i never felt victorious. it has never been pleasant to "overcome" this, because i have never overcomed, my personality is not something overcomable. even when they applauded me and said that i did very well, i always felt that it was not right and that i was forcing myself being something that i was not.<br>
i don't want to have to pretend and force myself to do things that don't give me pleasure because people think it's important and that "i'm going to get over it". i don't like doing anything with several people staring at me. i don't like being in the presence of many people and i don't like receiving attention from many people at the same time. is suffocating. i'm not insecure about what i do, i'm not afraid of failure, i'm not afraid of criticism, it's just uncomfortable.<br>
i always like to record and post things that i do to receive constructive opinions and criticisms for my improvement. i like people to see my things. i just do not want to be something that i'm not, please.<br>
i admire the work of people who perform live performances and concerts with skill and confidence, but i'm not a weak person or inferior to them for not liking doing these things. i was born that way and it's not something i want to change, at all. it never got in the way of developing what i wanted to do.<br>
i hope you understand this, i really wish i could continue to share content with you without feeling the pressure of living bad experiences. i made mistakes that i regret a lot, trying to change who i am, this is impure.<br>

where do you live, is it getting hot or cold ?<br>
here is a super nice climate, a gentle cold, soft sunlight + the rains have stopped completely. it's my favorite weather season !!<br>
for those who remember the past post, my trip with bubu was magical, i would like to travel with him all the time ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
it's not usual for me to travel, i sometimes spend years without leaving nearby. i want to travel a lot in the future <img src="https://i.imgur.com/V6FLtp7.gif"/><br>
<br>
i made two new playlists recently and would like to comment on them because i think they are interesting !<br>
i made a playlist with only brazilian music, since i was born and live here ( in são paulo ). i decided to do it because i know that the brazilian culture is extremely diverse and yet stereotyped. it's a country with a diversity of immigrants, so people don't usually know much about many super nice things that are from here. if you think of brazilian music you will definitely think of samba, but i do not particularly like it, as well as many people here.<br>
in this playlist i put together some popular music that everyone knows here and that were part of my childhood, only music i like and listen until nowadays !<br>
most of them are from the 80s and 90s, but these are the ones i really like. i think currently music here is not good at all ...<br>
but i would like to talk more about brazil, things that i love here and things that i consider terrible, the changes as the decades went by and my plans for the future,,, in another post ( spoiler : i do not intend to live here forever ).<br>
well, i hope you like the songs because they are great and very special for me ! i'll add more as you like.<br>
<br>
the other playlist that i would like to talk about is the asmr one. it's a playlist i've been thinking about for some time, since i usually watch a lot of asmr channels that are not very well known and many videos that i like are asmr not intentional. you will find all kind of stimmy and aesthetically pleasing videos !<br>
most videos are from japanese and korean channels, but some videos are in english and portuguese.<br>
i hope this playlist will help you relax and discover new content !!<br>
maybe you can even learn to make some recipes <sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jdce4lV.gif"/></sub></sub><br>

these drawings are so lovely !! her name is julie ♡<br>
i really enjoyed painting the little flowers on the dress, it was very relaxing.<br>
<br>
today i decided to answer to you several doubts and curiosities related to the changes that have happened in my social media over the last years.<br>
<br><br>

i created the page with a friend and the tumblr blog later, in order to improve the content of the page, improving its aesthetics. the problem is that our opinions were very different and she posted things very different from me, so everything was a mess. so far so good, but the biggest problem was that she liked to post things from kink blogs and lots of offensive stuff that i think it's very bad and ruined the page environment completely. our friendship dissolved over time ( not only because of that ) and she decided she didn't want to post on the page or tumblr anymore for lack of time, so i erased all the content that i definitely hate and left everything clean and neat again. posting alone i could have control over the content quality and aesthetics. i hope that everything has been completely deleted, i'm very ashamed of this past. if you find anything, PLEASE let me know !<br>
<br>
　　　𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚏𝚊𝚗 𝚙𝚒𝚌 𝚍𝚊𝚢 _<br>
who knows the not bad page since its beginning remembers that saturday was a day where i posted pictures from followers. the intention was to post beautiful pics that matched the aesthetics of the page, but things didn't go very well.. saturday became a very annoying day, people only sent super edited selfies and poor quality pics, even super inappropriate ones. and if i didn't post those pics, people would get really mad at me and keep spamming more and more photos every day !! of course one day my patience was over and i had to end it. i deleted all the pictures.<br>
<br>
　　　𝚖𝚒𝚍𝚍𝚕𝚎𝚙𝚘𝚝 𝚙𝚊𝚐𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚎𝚗𝚝 _<br>
this page was made to post my personal stuff + things that inspire me. it was before i started making this website, it was my last chance to use a social media as a personal space and of course it wasn't a good idea because it's facebook, even if a fb page, it's still fb, and i don't like it at all, i just like to post aesthetics there. i wasn't able to post my stuff properly, only images ! so, i gived up in a few months, and stopped posting everything personal, even images. i started making this website, and continued posting art that inspire me on this page, because it's still nice to post and people can get inspired too ! i really like to spread the art of talented people.<br>

this story is quite complicated and people are always doing theories and <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/PsOlNuM.png" target="_blank">posting</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/I4WhevB.png" target="_blank">screenshots</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/rm1AqD9.png" target="_blank">about</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/O5ETyMe.png" target="_blank">it</a>.. i think it's time to say what really happened to my ig : i used my acc for a short six months ( approximately ), problems began to happen at three months, i couldn't stop following people or following more people, my acc was frozen for about a month like this. i ignored it, but then i could no longer comment, they just vanished. then things started to get really heavy : my pics were erased randomly. sometimes it took a few days, a few hours, sometimes it was instantaneous, it would always disappear. i was already with many followers to that point, i was losing many because my account was becoming a mess. i was upset and contacted the instagram countless times, until one day they said that my account had been hacked. they did nothing about it really so i changed the password several times, but the problem persisted, random comments and pics were erased all the time. i always put the link of my ig on fb pages, so i had many followers, but when i started to suspect the activities i told everyone to stop following me because i would make another account, so i lost a massive number of followers ( i don't know if this was really the cause of the loss of followers because it was really a lot ). i deleted most of the pics, i left only 15 there and i didn't use the acc anymore. i decided not to make another account at all because of the problems and how nobody did anything to help me. the acc is still there until today.<br>
<br>
<br>
are we clear now ? i hope so !<br>

hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QwgXhbN.gif"/><br>
i would like to thank once again the support you give me, it is really very special for me !!<br>
the ideas you give me are very useful and i never tire of saying thank you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3ubYtGu.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4xWUuUR.gif"/><br>
because of my routine post yesterday i received some messages thanking the inspiration for organization and productivity, but i also received some rather sad messages saying that they couldn't be productive or follow schedules like me.<br>
i would like to clarify that although schedules are important, it is not always possible to follow them.<br>
sometimes i go to sleep later than i intended, sometimes i wake up with a headache, i don't force myself to go beyond my limits <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrqO7A4.gif"/><br>
everyone has different limits, you don't have to do multiple tasks every day, you don't have to wake up at 6:30 am, it's different for every person !<br>
your routine should be tailored to your lifestyle and your chores and hobbies should be things that you feel good doing, and i didn't include household chores in the routine because they vary according to need, but i have these as well, every day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTuY6k2.gif"/><br>
it's important to be productive but it's also important to stay healthy and happy, never forget <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qjiy032.gif"/><br>
<br>
soooooo, i'm super happy these days because tomorrow, day 5, me and bubu have completed 5 years of dating ♡ !!!!<br>
we're going to take a little trip together and i'm super extremely excited and i dream about it every day !!<br>
i love him so so so so so much <img src="https://i.imgur.com/g5pvtoc.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ANrPV0v.gif"/><br>

next time i want to record something in portuguese, i think it would be interesting.<br>
what do you think ?<br>
<br>
so /// because of yesterday's very personal post with information about my personality, some people asked me to post some things about my body as well. i thought a lot about it because it's very intimate and i don't like to post so many things like that ...<br>
but i decided that i'll post, since these are information that anyone who knows me personally would know, there is nothing so secret about it.<br>
i'll add these in the faq :<br>
<br>
✂　my height is 5,5. average, i guess ?<br>
✂　i weight 117 lbs. i think i'm skinny, but not super skinny, i'm okay.<br>
✂　i don't want to share measurements here, but i really like my body shape ! according to my measures, i'm hourglass figure.<br>
✂　my skin is pale, but not super pale. i hate tanning because my skin is really sensitive and turns red only ; ;<br>
✂　my hair changes color very much according to the lighting, but it also becomes clearer if i go out in the sun. it's dark blond / light brown and sometimes it gets a little bit orange, but it's only noticeable in the sunlight.<br>
✂　i like to keep a "himecut" in my hair, with short side bangs ( it's cute but also a bit more mature than straight bangs ). i cut my hair myself. i'm lazy so it's common for my bangs to be super long + my hair is quite wavy, so the cut is not so noticeable.<br>
✂　my eyes are between blue and green ( cyan, turquoise ) + a little bit grayish.<br>
✂　i don't know my shoe size to be honest, but my feet are 24cm.<br>
✂　um... i'm a-cup ;////;<br>
<br>
... of course i would not leave the post with just that, it would be shameful.<br>
i have something much more important to post on today's q&a, super very extremely important :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i would like to talk about these two adjectives that are so confusing to people : pure & innocent.<br>
these are actually extremely important things, but are treated as something far, almost impossible to achieve. and that's not true, because it's something we can all go back to.<br>
to explain it better, let's define purity and innocence :<br>
purity, as i have already commented in other posts, is something that you are when you're being yourself. when you act naturally and follow your heart, when you do not listen to what others think is good for you, but what your heart says is best for you. your heart wants you to have a clear conscience, want you to stay safe and healthy, wants you to be happy. it's not always the easiest path, but it's always the right one, the pure one. purity is literally not be contaminated by external influences. it's hard because we live in society and we need to please others, but it doesn't mean that you need to change who you are ( not even a little bit ) to be a nice person, and be happy.<br>
innocence is something that people often confuse with ignorance. when you don't know things by choice, you are being ignorant, which is a bad quality. innocence is when you see the world in a beautiful way, when you believe in your dreams, believe things can get better, do not judge others before you know, when even after being bitten by a dog, do not you think all dogs are evil. so, innocence is more linked to positivity, it's a quality of being radiant and full of love, even having gone through difficult things, or not. of course it's easier to be positive when you don't have traumas to deal with, but that's not the point. it is possible, and it is necessary for you to be happy !<br>
children are pure and innocent because they have not been "contaminated" by society's pressure to be different from who they really are, to give up their dreams, to think the world and people are bad and it's always getting worse. this is not right and it's not true. it's a super toxic thought.<br>
other ( nonhuman ) animals are like children forever, for at least none of them still live in society like humans. society itself is not a problem, but people just don't have the maturity to deal with it in a healthy way. it's something that people should educate themselves and educate their children so that we can all be happier !!<br>
never think that you have no hope, that you are dirty or rotten, that your dreams can't come true, that magic doesn't exist. erase it forever from your life !!! learning to evaluating your behavior and the way you see the world is very important to becoming a better and more satisfied person. believe in your dreams, make the little you from the past proud of who you became today ♡ !<br>
<br>
i really hope it touched your heart !<br>

aaaa //// i'm so thankful for the cute messages i've received lately !!<br>
you all are so kind to me, i don't deserve it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OT3hgIG.gif"/><br>
also, i love it when you send me suggestions. i like to post things you want to see !<br>
<br>
um, so, do you remember that i was training to be ambidextrous ?<br>
i think i can consider that i already got there !!<br>
i really can't believe how fast that was, i thought it would take a long time <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2fh66l4.gif"/><br>
i am training every day using my left hand to do day-to-day tasks, and to write.<br>
i'd say i can do things 80% the same way with my left hand now !<br>
and i can write with the same handwriting, but it's a bit slower ( i never can write too fast anyway )<br>
well, i am very proud of the progress ♡ !!<br>
<br>
today the post will be a little more personal, since you have been asking for some little things ///<br>
these days i was writing down my routine, as usual. i usually write down daily task lists, but i always had some items that i repeated every day.<br>
for ease, i wrote down these items in a txt, which i kept for a while. it was not very cute, so i thought i should write it somewhere else ...<br>
i was in the mood to do some pretty cute html page, so i did one with some things from my routine !!<br>
it was quite spontaneous, i was not even going to show it to anyone at first.<br>
but as you asked for some more personal things like that, and it was so cute, i decided to post !<br>
and with a super cute url ( comfy.now.im ), of course <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2DYo6uh.gif"/><br>
i will leave here a backup file, as always :<br>

well.. like i said, i can record reading stories, fairytales .. i like this kind of content and it's a little hard to find, so i'll try hard to do it, if you want, of course ; ;<br>
( please do not ask me to record more singing cause this is too much for me LOL )<br>
<br>
because of the other post where i say that i don't like people to "guess" my personality through tests, astrology, blood type or anything, you asked me to post things about my personality.<br>
i'm actually quite honored that you really care about me that way, it's very sweet <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WatUq79.gif"/><br>
i thought about it for a while, i don't really like to talk about myself so deeply, but since this is a more personal post... here it is :<br>

　　　　　𝓅𝓮𝓇𝓈𝓸𝓃𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓉𝓎 𝓉𝓇𝒶𝒾𝓉𝓈 :<br>
<br>
❀　i'm very shy & introverted. so, because of my introversion, i don't feel bad for being shy, it's just part of me ;<br>
❀　i'm full of love and i do my best to take care of others and myself. i want to bring comfort and safety to everyone !<br>
❀　i have difficulties in approaching and sometimes i never feel comfortable near some people ;<br>
❀　when i'm comfortable with people, i talk a lot about random things, sometimes i even talk too much ///<br>
❀　i usually adapt to different situations and different people "changing moods", sometimes i get into it a lot and i feel confused, but i'm always myself ;<br>
❀　i'm always evaluating my behavior to improve myself, but sometimes i take it too seriously and get overwhelmed ;<br>
❀　i love rules ! i love to make rules for myself, to have rules made for me and to follow them. rules often make me happy because they make me a better person ;<br>
❀　i make lists all the time to be able to have an organized routine and take time to practice all my hobbies. feeling busy with things that i like makes me feel pretty satisfied !<br>
❀　i think too much about everything and sometimes i feel melancholic ;<br>
❀　i deeply value the purity. for me purity is directly linked to your true personality, who you really are. i never forget who i am and what i believed and wanted from myself when i was a child and i want more than anything to be proud of myself, the child i will always be.<br>
<br>
　　　　　𝓮𝓍𝓉𝓇𝒶 :<br>
<br>
❀　my sense of humor is quite childish, so i laugh at really silly things ;<br>
❀　i cry a lot, sad and happy ;<br>
❀　my main interest is beautiful things and to make things beautiful ;<br>
❀　i like everything that warms my heart and i try to fill my life with these things ;<br>
❀　people say i smell like vanilla. i think i smell like honey ///<br>
❀　i love animals, especially babies, i love taking care of babies ♡ !!!<br>
❀　i love nature, she is everything to me, i struggle daily to feel part of her and understand my instincts and role in life. this has made me extremely happy and helps me overcome any personal problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
.. that's it ///<br>

i always feel like a very good girl when i finish doing what i have to do <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tXEidyn.gif"/><br>
( don't worry, i'm having enough rest, or i'd be overwhelmed, right ? )<br>
<br>

i've been embroidering a lot lately, but these are the first ones and are more special to show you for now.<br>
<br>

i'll show you my phone theme and also my line, with the two themes i have so far <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PPUtdFo.gif"/><br>

even though my phone is really old now, i think it's really cute !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/a3LyqhZ.gif"/><br>
but when i have a new one, i'm going to make it even cuter and show you.<br>
about the video style, you know i could simply record the screen, but apps to record don't work well on my phone ( which is pretty old, as i said )<br>
ah, and please don't ask me to add on line, because it's extremely personal ////<br>
<br>
for today's q&a the subject will be very... heavy.<br>
i don't know if it's appropriate for you if you're a minor, but i would say that it is something very important and needs to be talked about. i'll be careful !
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
the sexualization is a very controversial subject. it can be seen as horrible, beautiful, okay, or even as an art form. it can be beautiful, but it can also be dangerous. there is a fine line between healthy and unhealthy sexuality, which causes people to be often completely in favor or against. i think there are big limits to it.<br>
sexual content and pornography is very dangerous because often this industry involves people being harmed and abused, and make sex seem vulgar and casual. this becomes an addiction and is totally wrong, it ruins you, makes you have a lot of problems and mess up your whole life !!<br>
this goes a long way from kinks and different forms of sexuality, it's about self-respect, safety, happiness, purity and health.<br>
i personally consider that people who are involved with pornography and prostitution ( even on the internet ) are often source of many problems, for themselves and for many others ( even children ) and i totally do not support this industry. i am not exactly against drawings and animations, for they are not real people ( when it comes especially to art, i support quite as well as artistic nudity in any case ). but, this type of content still has moral limits and should be reserved for adults, always.<br>
puberty is the time when we should be very careful about sexuality, because it is not the moment to do it, but it's natural to be curious and very important to be educated about it. repressed sexuality is often degenerate. many children at puberty become hypersexualized and even not having sex, come very close to it several times and with several different people. they can often develop weird kinks and even support pedophilia. they get hurt and traumatized for a lifetime, even hurting other people in the process.<br>
<br>
the excessive sexualization can bring hypersexualization to people, which is very dangerous for their lives.<br>
the sex itself is not impure, since we're animals and it's healthy and natural to have sexuality.<br>
but sex is not only for having babies but also for pleasure. this is when it gets dangerous.<br>
using food as an example : there are delicious foods that are healthy and some that are bad for our bodies and even if food is essential for our survival, consuming too much food can destroy our lives. everything has limits.<br>
hypersexuality can lead to need for casual sex, and it is always a problem because the more you do, the more you want to do. this in addition to being able to bring diseases, is dangerous, not healthy and bad for your mind.<br>
this is a major problem of early sexuality, since children do not have a safe way to have sex. it's always wrong, harmful and traumatic for them.<br>
it's very super important that sexuality be brought in a healthy way to make everyone happy. treating it as wrong and dirty does not help in this process !!<br>
the right sex would be not necessarily to make babies, but the one we do healthfully often and only with people we trust. the sex with whom we love is infinitely better and makes you and the other person happy. it doesn't hurt anyone, it doesn't make you sad, it's pure, safe and comfortable. makes you feel loved. there is no way to be something bad !<br>
<br>
so take care of yourselves, please, it will do miracles to your mental health. i promise.<br>
i really hope my words are easy to understand !<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZqlLhvz.gif"/><br>
the rain doesn't stop, day in day out .. it's starting to get boring, honestly.<br>
i'm reading a lot about gardening these days <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kg945C0.gif"/><br>
i've had a lot of trouble because the super humid weather of the season is making them bad ; ;<br>
if you have any suggestions, i would appreciate it !!<br>
<br>
i don't know if i already told you, but i'm right-handed.<br>
since i was little i always wanted to be ambidextrous, because it seems to be an incredible and useful ability !<br>
i've always been too lazy to start practicing, but now i'm really training my left hand, and it has not been that hard. writing is the hardest part <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ya4MhRH.gif"/><br>
taking advantage of my interest in calligraphy, i'm training every day and it's been a lot of fun, i'm improving fast !!<br>
i feel even sorry for having underestimated my left hand all this time ///<br>
( oh i also have trained my sleep, sleeping and waking up every day at the same time. it was always hard for me, but bubu is encouraging me and i'm doing very well <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nl03Rvi.gif"/> )<br>
by the way, i would like to show you something super nice that i made :<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HPfgN41.gif"/> fonts with my handwriting <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HPfgN41.gif"/><br>
i really really liked the result, even if the "puf" one has got some spacing problems .. i think it's still ok !<br>
the "bby" font is only hiragana & katakana. i made it based on the fact that i use a lot of kanas, and this is pretty childish, but kanjis are so haaard ;///;<br>
well, i hope you like it !<br>

<br>
so, today the q&a subject will be lighter, as i intend to bring something controversial in the next post LOL<br>
it's something that i really wanted to talk about, because you ask a lot about it !<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
how do i dress usually ? do i follow styles ?<br>
since i was free to choose my clothes, i always tried to wear something otome kei, because it was my favorite accessible style, but at the end of the day i was just wearing oversized shirts and sweaters with skirts / shorts and high socks ;///;<br>
( + bell choker + tiny bows at my hair )<br>
pretty much boring, but i wasn't very good with fashion until my 16 at least. i did a lot of research to find a style that really fits me !<br>
<br>
at the moment, i take inspirations from :<br>
<br>
✄ <b>larme kei</b> ( lots of handmade clothes, but i love rose marie seoir and axes femme )<br>
✄ <b>mori girl</b> ( on fall and winter i do wear it a loooooot, so cozy and comfy, lots of handmade clothes too )<br>
✄ <b>cult party</b> ( i have a few coords that I LOVE but i don't wear it a lot, the fabric is just so delicate ; ; )<br>
✄ <b>lolita</b> ( i don't have any coord yet so it's basically à la mode. my dream is to wear classical-sweet, it's hard to wear on non-special occasions, but i think i can adapt to casual. i'm studying this style for YEARS i love it )<br>
✄ <b>himekaji</b> ( basicaly because of liz lisa, cliché, i know )<br>
<br>
✁ & in everyday situations i'm inspired by that soft and clean aesthetic clothes ( not very creative but it's cute ) ✃<br>
<br>
so, i know lolita since i was 13 and i study lolita since i was 16. but why i don't use it YET ?<br>
i sincerely think that at this point i know how to coordinate, i don't think lolita is too hard, it just have many rules and you need a lot of study, help and research. as i said, i have been studying for many years, so i think i'm okay with lolita to make a good first outfit now.<br>
um, i don't have many items that i can use with lolita right now, and i also know that i don't need lots of money to buy good lolita clothes. i have no problem with handmade and non-brand outfits, because i know it's very possible to have a super cute and high quality lolita outfit, full handmade. as you may know, i love handmade outfits and most of my clothes are handmade.<br>
but about lolita, specificly .. i know it's dumb, but i have a big wish :<br>
i need a full angelic pretty outfit.<br>
and that's not because i'm insecure about non-brand clothes, i just love angelic pretty too much and i need my first outfit to be super special for me. i don't care if it's expensive or anything, i just think it would be perfect to have a classical-sweet outfit, super high quality and from my favorite brand.<br>
because it's expensive, i'm waiting for money. it can be silly, but it's really really special to me to have my first outfit from angelic pretty.<br>
also, i really want outfits from innocent world and baby, i really love those brands and i will feel complete when i start with lolita supporting them.<br>
after that, i'll probably coordinate brand clothes with handmade clothes, i think i can do that, and i think it will be magical ! i can't wait ...<br>
<br>
i hope it was a fun to read !!<br>
fashion is a big interest of mine.<br>

i'm very proud of the result, what do you think ?<br>
<br>
umm and i also have something super very special that i found and despite having exited a lot to post here because i am extremely shy with my voice, i think it's worth it, because i worked hard !<br>
that's from a couple of years ago, when i was part of a small cover group with some friends. i had a very bad microphone, so i got a new one and recorded some songs and my friend edited.<br>
i'm very shy, so i didn't show to many people besides them and it ended up getting lost in time. luckily, i backed up this specific song, my fav one. i decided to post here today :<br>

i don't have the microphone anymore, but i'd like to buy another. i don't think i'd record more songs because it's really hard for me, but maybe i could talk to you fluffies ?<br>

i've seen a lot of people all over internet spreading hate to feel better about their problems, and hate is NEVER the solution !<br>
hating people will not help you or make you a better person, it's immature and very very bad !<br>
writing about solutions, about what you think it's bad and must be helped ( almost everything can be helped if you try your best ) is important, but hating people is just not right !<br>
how do you expect things to get better by making other people hate you because you hate them !?<br>
nature is sure to teach you to value the really important things in life, and you can be sure that it is not internet drama.<br>
please, be kinder <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SpNv58B.gif"/><br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GuYGws3.gif"/><br>
today's post will be important to me, so i hope you enjoy it ! i'm a lil bit sleepy but i'll try hard to write everything right <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bAZEHQJ.gif"/><br>
so, i think i never told you but i like to make a lot of papercrafts and paper houses, i also have a wooden house that i want to paint and decorate ( when it's done i'll show you for sure )<br>
i am a frequent papercraft maker and i also like to gift, i live in a very humid place so it's hard to keep paper things ...<br>
some nice things i made i had to throw away because of the mold ; ;<br>
so i just keep with me my ult favs clean and organized so as not to ruin !<br>
i have here at the moment two medium houses, five small houses, the howl's moving castle ( which i'll show you ) and my super cute wooden house !!<br>
i don't know if i'll be able to keep the castle for so long, but i'll try to keep it clean !<br>
in the future i intend to set up a suitable and protected environment to store this kind of thing, to avoid dust and mold ( one of my big wishes is to collect sylvanian families !!! )<br>
<br>
aaand this is the castle, which took me an average of 6 months to make and i'm sooo proud of :<br>

i don't mind if you identify with them too ! i don't take it that seriously.<br>
( please don't call me by their names, because i don't like it ; ; )<br>
<br>
<br>
now, the subject i want to talk about is something that i think is extremely important, since i have seen it makes many people insecure, including me, and that was my conclusion about it :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
there's always a beauty competition between different people, races, species and even non-existencial things, and this is honestly so unhealthy !!<br>
there's even a thing called 2.5D wich is "almost non-real pretty" people. i think the desire of being perfect is normal, but it's also dangerous.<br>
people who know how to be beautiful in their best capacity, as healthy and captivating human beings, are really the ones who manage to be almost non-real, so you don't have to be artificial for it. if you try to be perfect you will fail because it's not possible. don't push the limits, just be yourself ! be the best version of yourself, the best you can be, always.<br>
you can't compare yourself with things you'll never be, it's very unhealthy. everything has totally diferent kind of beauties. 2D characters for example are usually made to be pretty besides they usually are not realistic enough to have the details that normal people have, so it's natural that you wanna be like that too. but we are made by nature itself. everything in nature is different and beautiful in its own way, and so are you. we are part of the nature. you don't have to worry about it, at all, because you don't have to be the perfect pretty to be happy.<br>
i think it's also very important to say that your body don't need to be pretty to keep you healthy and alive, and that's the more important thing ! beauty does not make you a good person, you have to work on it.<br>
beauty exist in many ways, i know it may sound cliché, but the inner beauty will really make you more and more beautiful to everyone, including to yourself.<br>
it's okay if you want to look at the mirror and be pleased, we like beautiful things. but it's not that hard. everyone have beauty parts to look at and feel happy. what people say it's pretty, it's not necessarily true for everyone. a good example is fashion, design and aesthetics : everyone have a different taste, even if it's more common to like some kind of clothes and aesthetics, maybe you like some things that are uncommon. it's the same thing, and that's why everything can be beautiful in some way ! you are beautiful in lots of ways, and if you don't believe it, just try to find things that make you happy about yourself and focus on that things !<br>
there's a special beauty in everyone. you are unique, and the cute features you have are purely luck, that's super special ! also, you can be even prettier if you work on being a better person every day, a perfect version of what it's possible for you to be. for example, there are small things that automatically make us feel more beautiful sometimes ( as fashion and makeup ). the most important thing is to feel comfortable and keep healthy. be proud of your race, your species and your existence. be proud of being you !<br>
<br>
please, think about it, because we usually forget some important points that would make us truly happier !!<br>
be kind to yourself <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5LHkYOP.gif"/><br>

i'm melting completely .. summer makes me so uncomfortable <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QbRprCw.gif"/><br>
it has been raining a lot, too. it's not the kind of nice rain you can get out with cute umbrellas and have fun, i'm talking about very scary thunderstorms !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/St54IDr.gif"/><br>
i wish the summer were not so extreme here ...<br>
it's difficult to do anything in this climate, but i wanted to paint some little things that i'll show here for you :<br>

do you think it got better ?<br>
<br>
so, today, i want to talk about a very important subject that i've been dealing with for years and it certainly bothers me a lot ; ;<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i am very interested in astrology and any other "pseudoscience", as well as personality tests, i usually read a lot about it.<br>
but i honestly don't like to talk about that kind of thing, not a little bit. the reason is that most of the time people think they can know everything about others from small information. this is obviously not true and makes me feel very uncomfortable and dissociated seeing people trying to know things about me without knowing me ! it's almost disrespectful, to be honest.<br>
i will not go into other subjects, i will just talk about astrology here, which is a very good example :
astrology is something very complex. people have birth charts, there are signs for each planet, alignments, houses, many details to study.<br>
astrologers study a lot to learn to correctly interpret and evaluate a birth chart, a very relevant example of how a chart can have diverse interpretations is that twins have identical birth charts, but may have completely different personalities.<br>
each person manifests parts of the chart differently, there is no standard for this. people, even so, make very heavy conclusions about others from just a few details of a person's birth chart. i think this is just so wrong, indeed annoying !<br>
for this reason, i do not like to talk about astrology or other similar subjects with almost anyone, i will not show you my birth chart here ever and i kindly ask you that please don't share stereotyped information about my solar sign with me, this makes me very sad.<br>
<br>
i hope you understand my point !<br>
i don't judge people who identify 100% with their solar signs and like this kind of stereotyped information, it just is not my case and i think it's bad that people don't respect it ..<br>
please be kind to others !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xbvdBR5.gif"/><br>

2018 !!!<br>
i really really hope this year to be full of hope, achievement and love for you all !!<br>
you have made me so happy since i made this website, i have just felt joy in updating it and bringing new things to you. thank you soooo much !<br>
the new years is always a complicated time to do things, so i have nothing really new to show here today .. i'm sorry <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xj1OmvF.gif"/><br>
but, i would like to make a small but very very important request today :<br>
<br><br>
please spread love, be kind to each other !!!<br>
you don't know how important it is and how it makes a difference on a person's day to receive a loving message.<br>
even if it's in anonymous, be sure to tell people you admire how much you love them, how special and incredible they are !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3xiRoNK.gif"/><br>
i promise you'll never regret doing it and it will feel great !<br>
spread love on the internet, spread love with letters and secret messages, spread words of love in every way you can !<br>
<br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QU4wxaT.gif"/></center><br>
<br><br>
sooo, today i don't have a q&a here as i have some updates on my tumblr about.<br>
i updated some little sutff about aesthetics + add :<br>
<br>
♡　i can't do personal posts because it would be extremely uncomfy for me, i just post personal stuff here on my website !!<br>
<br>
♡　i'm sorry, but i really can't reblog promos or do ask / tag games ( i just don't want my blog to be very personal, sorry /// you all are so lovely ; ; ) but it really warms my heart when people tag me in all kind of cute stuff, please feel free to send me everything you think i would like.<br>
<br>
♡　i can't pay attention to every single interaction, but i try my best to make sure i never reblog from bad people. if i interact with someone who is really toxic please tell me quickly, this is very important to me.<br>
<br>
♡　you are free to unfollow me, softblock to break mutuals or just hardblock me ! i just want you to be comfortable.<br>
<br>
♡　i always always read links and i interact with most personal posts i see, sometimes i can't because i'm too shy, i'm sorry ; ;<br>
<br>
♡　i absolutely love all my mutuals !!!!<br>
<br><br>
i would also like to say a little note about my little world on <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">ywot</a> ! and this one goes to the faq :<br>
there is a little free space to talk, but if you already know this site, you know there is a huge amount of people who spam random text and ascii art in any free space you see.<br>
my space is blocked for pasting, which relieves spam a little bit, but there is still a simple script line that allows you to paste in any free space !<br>
i really like this site because i've met some really nice people in it, but the point is : there are lots of immature and dumb people who like to spam random offensive stuff or cursing. i don't really care about that, and i can easily erase that sort of thing ( and i always do it when i have the opportunity ) but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing i suggest you be careful ! take care ♡<br>
<br>
and that's it ! i'm sorry if this post was small, but i hope what i said is of some use to you<br>
i love you all so so so much !!! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8PfKwQX.gif"/><br>
thank you for being here for me !<br>

merry xmas !!!!! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZGSvNUX.gif"/><br>
my ult fav holiday, the time of year when i get listening to all ragnarok christmas bgm ( which i suggest to all of you, since it's what most helps me to get the christmas spirit )<br>
i think i never told you, but one of my biggest dreams is to see snow. i've NEVER seen snow, since where i live it doesn't snow.<br>
it may seem crazy to you, but it's true, and it makes me extremely sad that i never had a christmas with winter and snow !!<br>
in fact, summer has just arrived, and it is certainly about 30°C right now ...<br>
but the christmas spirit and a lot of ice cream always helps me feel better !<br>
i know that one day i will have a traditional christmas in the northern hemisphere, since my desire is to live there in some years. but that's a story for another post ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cq3logb.gif"/><br>
<br>
as you may have noticed, i still can't start with my shop, and summer has arrived ...<br>
i'm sorry for this, but i'm having some personal problems and it's difficult to make the items and organize everything ! besides that there are still some materials missing ...<br>
but i promise it will not be that long before sales start !<br>
<br>
coming back to christmas, i received a lovely gift from bubu : the paper doll mate coloring book <img src="https://i.imgur.com/R2rmMkX.gif"/><br>
it's something i was really longing for, and i'm so happy !!!<br>
it's definitely the cutest coloring book i've ever seen in my life, and i'm super excited to get started <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SKh3GVb.gif"/><br>
i've been looking for scanned pages of this book because i didn't want to paint it only once, i wanted to be able to paint as much as i wanted ( even digitally )<br>
as i didn't find anything, i decided to scan all the coloring pages myself, so the book can be perfect forever, as i can print the pages as many times as i want !<br>
i thought these pages could be a good christmas gift for you, so here they are :<br>

the book contains other pages with wonderful illustrations, texts, has high quality, and is adorable !<br>
i strongly suggest that you buy this book yourself, or give it as a gift to your loved ones <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GO9edJs.gif"/><br>
<br>
now, i would like to talk about this subject that has bothered me a lot on the internet because people are saying very rude things about each other just like a chain of hate ; ;<br>
this makes me very sad, and i feel that it's important spread positivity about it, although it is complicated to write about, i hope you understand my point :<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
( before starting, i would like to point out that in referring to boys and girls i mean the natural female and male sides of people, such as the sexes ! )<br>
<br>
humans are animals, above all else. and animals are born boys or girls, to procreate and fulfill their roles in nature.<br>
human beings are rational animals, so sometimes we are not satisfied with what we're born from. our heart is pure and knows what is best for us, and we must be happy to make others happy.<br>
therefore, we can choose our role in nature ( and society, of course )<br>
but there is something very bad that affects our choices of heart that would make us happy and good : people choose what they are, what they like, their way of living and their roles in society, based on what others think is cool !<br>
this is an impure thought, for we should not change who we truly are only because "it's cool", we must be pure, be ourselves above all else.<br>
there is some kind of odious fashion where it says girls should live with the goal of being better than boys, and vice versa.<br>
and there is also another one that boys have built up today's society alone, and that girls have never helped at all.<br>
this is a very toxic thought that affects our lives and society, we should not be against each other !!<br>
<br>
boys and girls are no better than others, just different. biologically, we have some advantages and disadvantages over the other, but this is natural and there is nothing wrong.<br>
we are like cake and pudding, there is no better or worse, just personal preference !<br>
therefore, we can be who we really want, because our heart knows the right way.<br>
a society works well and happy when everyone is pure, are themselves, and so can fulfill their roles in society, happy and comfortable with their lives !<br>
the role of all people in society is to do good, to spread love and kindness, to bring education and health to others and to be happy. this can be done by all people when they are living stable and comfortable lives!<br>
you don't have to have children or form a family for it, if you don't want to, even if nature has made your body for it. what matters is meeting and knowing who you really are. if you feel confused, you are not happy and you do not make others happy.<br>
if you feel that getting married, having children and caring for the house would make you happy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, of course !<br>
even if your friends tell you that it would make you dependent and unhappy, does not mean it's true. economic independence is not really independence in life.<br>
people seek a happy society for all through toxic thoughts of superiority. we must work together as a family ! when we are together, the advantages and disadvantages of being a boy or girl does not matter, as they can complement each other in solving problems !<br>
we all have special abilities and unique talents. it may be difficult to find what we want to be and do in our lives, but it's very important that we do not follow the instincts or opinions of others, but the heart, which is who we certainly are.<br>
<br>
<br>
i'm sorry if i wrote many things repeated, i hope you can understand !<br>
i hope this has some good feeling for you, because the internet is full of people fighting over being better than the other and this makes me very upset ...<br>

i now have custom domains and ssl for my tumblrs !!<br>
i'm so happy about it, i managed to keep everything 100% covered with ssl, and i changed all the links, for the consistency.<br>
and now i've also put some html files online : the html tester ( milk.honey.my ), the offline ywot ( rosy.latteart.fi ) and also a new page of unicode text converters ( safe.cyberlove.us ) !<br>
i like collecting unicodes, and there are some "unicode fonts" that few people know about and i think it's cool to share ! these converters were made by me for easier use.<br>
i had doubts between using tumblr or github to host those files, and i chose github. unfortunately i can't use ssl for these, at least for now <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bAXd801.gif"/><br>
the domains are so lovely, right ? <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qSScj23.gif"/></sub><br>
they are safe, since i'm using for static pages, but they are not mine so i have no guarantee that they will work forever ; ;<br>
anyway i will keep the links page updated, and for security, the html files are here, as always :<br>

well, about links, there's something i need to say, even if people don't really seem to care about it, i do care :<br>
i like to put links the right way: if it's http, i put http, if it's https, i put https, if it's www, i put www, if it's not www, i don't put www. i do that for all the links i put, everywhere, because i think this is the right thing to do ; i don't want people to click on a link that is different from the reality, i don't think it's right.<br>
but, i want to get ssl to this website ( someday, because it's hard to adapt everything ) and well... it's http so all the links are http ( it was once www but it doesn't really make a difference ), and when it's https i think i can't change ALL THE LINKS EVERYWHERE... like, i can do that, but it's too many links and i'll certainly forget about some link somewhere and it will cause total inconsistense, which i think is even worse. that's okay because all the navigators as i know, convert links with http to https if it's the case, so i don't need to change it. the problem could be otherwise ( https to http ) because there will be a security problem with scripts and hosted stuff, which is not the case ; so i'll keep all the links http, if you don't mind ! let me know what you think !<br>
i just wanted to say this to keep you informed <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xi8k93o.gif"/><br>
<br>
as i said in the last post, this post will be very special, so i have here also a piano composition :<br>

　　　　　( there's more, you can ask )<br>
<br>
i really don't define them as ids because it's a little complicated to do that, but i can say i identify with them a lot & they are really heartwarming for me !<br>
that being said, i don't care at all if you like them too.<br>
actually, i don't feel that doubles ever make people invalid, but i think it's always okay to seek comfort, right ? i just can't agree with people being mean with each other ; ;<br>
<br>

so i'll end up here ! i hope it was interesting to read <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SNGCMAT.gif"/><br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eU2a6A1.gif"/><br>
as you can see, i did a new layout !!<br>
i planned to do this layout for next year, but i had problems with the server and would have to readjust all the pages for the new one, so i took the opportunity to finish the layout right now.<br>
i hope you are enjoying it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vp28uvY.gif"/><br>
i updated several pages with new content and refined the portfolio !<br>
even the chat is also with new look and new emojis.<br>
<br>
if you want to know, the server i was using was weebly. i liked it, it was a good server, but one day suddenly they ignored my payment plan and said i was not entitled to premium services, even if i had confirmed the plan and everything !!<br>
they simply put a banner on my site, which made me very angry <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MofgDxY.gif"/><br>
i sent several messages and they, besides taking many days to respond, were rude with me <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OpBggFY.gif"/><br>
so i decided to switch servers. now, i use github, which has a good reputation and is very interesting to use, even because my site is static so i don't need complicated tools to edit it.<br>
<br>
well, these days i felt like repainting some old sketches. i'm having a lot of fun watching my progress !!<br>
this was the first one i repainted :<br>

halloween is coming, is coming !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JYt2us2.gif"/><br>
( a little sad here because living in the southern hemisphere is awful, it's spring now, super anticlimatic )<br>
anyway, i'm going to eat a lot of pumpkin candy and the heat will never stop me !!!!<br>
and how is your halloween going to be like ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DQwIi6u.gif"/><br>
<br>
sooo, i made a new flash game for milky woods !<br>
this time i got the urge to draw teddies, and i promise i'll stop LOL<br>
i decided to deactivate my dA account, i was pretty inactive there ...<br>
because of my inactivity, i never bothered to become a core, and my profile was pretty messed up for some time. recently, i have slightly customized, editing texts, avatar and gallery, so it was cute, but really, i don't have much to do there.<br>
maybe you noticed that i'm deactivating some inactive accounts, and that's because i'm trying to get rid of unnecessary social media ; ;<br>
the accounts that i keep online but inactive, is because i use them to keep contact with some people !<br>
i don't keep contact with anyone specifically on dA, so i think it's for the best to just deactivate.<br>
don't worry, i'm still going to make flash games and post here periodcly, as i promised !!<br>
if you came here from my dA account, i'm sorry for the inconvenience, you can still play all the games right <a href="https://middlepot.com/milky-woods" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">here</a><br>
aaand, here is the little game :<br>

please tell me what you think !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2R78VEf.gif"/><br>
<br>
today, i would like to talk about something that would be interesting, since some of you know me through projects, and others, well before that.<br>
before i create the name "middlepot" :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
what did i do on the internet before starting the projects and this website ?<br>
some of you have known me for quite some time because i played many online games, especially dress up games and ragnarok. i'm not going to get into this because i already have the gaming session, where you can check it out !<br>
i started with the internet very early, i was only 7 years old ( 2004 ). my mom always saw everything i did, so it was safe, don't worry LOL<br>
i used to play flash games, and i had msn, and a blog. everyone had blogs or personal websites on the internet, where they customized and posted all sorts of things. i was a kid so i was not good with those things, but i liked to post gifs with cute animals, lots of glitter and beautiful images that i found on other blogs and google.<br>
i didn't have social media at the time because i was very young and my mom wouldn't let me. i enjoyed visiting lots of websites with graphics and materials, beautiful blogs, and playing online games. my first online game was ragnarok, and my second, club penguin, if you wanna know.<br>
i only used the internet for 2 hours a day in the morning and i used this time to decorate my blog and play with my friends. it was so much fun and i have great memories of that time !<br>
i could have a social media ( orkut ) with 9 y/o, and i continued just posting cute graphics with lots of glitter, because it's just so adorable !<br>
i also knew several forums at that time, and began to communicate with people all over the world. my english was obviously horrible, but i used the google translator to help me. i never posted any real information or photo because i was taught that this is dangerous.<br>
i did several blogs, which were improving the quality of content and the layouts were becoming cuter. in 2006, i did the <a id="linkbjinho" data-target="spoiler1" class="btn-spoiler">first layout</a> that i really was very proud of !<br>

<br>
over time, the internet has been changing ... the blogs became unpopular, forums too, msn died, orkut died ... very sad, right ? ;-;<br>
i then looked for substitutes for the things i liked : i tried using facebook to replace orkut, but no one else cared about the glittery cute things and i was disappointed.<br>
i started using tumblr, which was well customizable and could fill the void that blogs left behind. it worked, even if it took a long time to find an aesthetic that would make me really happy, so i did several blogs until i got to my recent one ( it was during this time that i created the name middlepot ).<br>
my recent one, was done together with a friend of mine, who also made with me the not bad fb page, which should have the same aesthetics. but she and i had very different opinions of what we wanted to do and she'd post things that i didn't like, both on the tumblr and on the page ... it became a mess, and we ended up giving up doing it together. i'd like to talk more about it in another post, because it's a tricky subject ; ;<br>
anyway, i deleted her posts from tumblr and facebook, and then i got to what it is today : a safe and comfy place !<br>
the fb pages have similar content, which i get on tumblr. in this way, fb pages are extensions of my main tumblr, a way to bring content to people who don't know it.<br>
fb itself, i did not like to use as a social media. i also tried using instagram, but bad things happened and i gave up on it too. i'm used to the more open and customizable format the old internet had, so the tumblr was the place where i most adapted.<br>
to replace the forums, i found other places on the internet where i could communicate with various types of people, where i always remain anonymous as usual.<br>
to replace msn, which was the platform i always used to talk to my family and close friends, i decided to use line. line in my opinion resembles quite a lot of things, besides having super cute stickers and themes !!<br>
<br>
but in spite of having tumblr ( and fb pages ), other nice places on the internet & the cute line... i was still missing something, my little corner on internet, to be able to make layouts exactly as i imaginate & post every kind of things i want : a personal website !!<br>
so i did it, and here i am ♡ . * ･ ｡<br>
the 7 y/o me would be really proud of everything i'm doing right now. this website is really my favorite place on internet !<br>
it's all i wanted, here i can put together all the projects i do and all the content i like.<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this answers a few things about how i got here ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gQeft9B.gif"/><br>
and i wrote a lot, i hope it's not tiring to read ; ;<br>

i know i'm saying this all the time, but i'm really very impressed with the progress of this site, it's growing so fast !!<br>
it makes me extremely happy to know that things are going well here <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1GWPCfW.gif"/><br>
things in my life are complicated at the moment, so don't be surprised by my brief absences !<br>
i hope to start the store and improve some projects until the summer ( in december )<br>
about the frequency of blog posts, which are not exactly weekly, i'm trying to write posts as often as i get lots of good ideas for the q&a, but the plan is to keep the posts monthly, okay ? other pages, such as the status one, i will update more frequently.<br>
<br>
umm, as you know, i'm addicted to teddy bears. i honestly try to draw other things, but when i realize it, it's already a teddy bear. and also, bees, because i love bees !!<br>

<br>
for today's post, i will write about a subject that in fact, was the first request made here !<br>
since it's very complicated, this took a while to think about :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
age play, ddlg / cgl, there is a fine line between pedophilia and those kinks. how to identify dangerous situations, dangerous people, what's the limit ?<br>
i think the sex life between two adults, responsible for themselves, with consent, is something that allows things like kinks or lifestyles such as bdsm. any sub/dom relationship, have no relation whatsoever to incest or pedophilia. is something consented between two adults. anyway, it's a kink. in my opinion, kinks should in no way be publicly exposed, on the streets or on the internet, where children can see and be influenced. children can't have contact with these kind of things because it wouldn't be healthy.<br>
this unfortunately is something that has happened very often, and even worse, added to age play : ddlg / cgl has reached many minors and many adult pedophiles have had contact with these children through kink communities.<br>
these communities have become increasingly dangerous for minors, through the romanticization of pedophilia, child abuse and contact with kinks linked to childhood. even people who claim to be in a sfw ddlg / cgl community are not safe and are exposed to dangerous people as they use kink tags.<br>
communities of age regression that work hard to be a truly safe environment for people who don't use the agere as something sexual, are  anti ddlg. many people have gone against this kink, because of exposure to minors. it has become something horrible and manipulative.<br>
<br>
i agree that it is really very dangerous to associate childhood with sexuality, even if those involved are adults, and i firmly believe that kinks shouldn't be publicly exposed for children to see. neither of them.<br>
the only way to keep a kink safe and not harmful to anyone is without public exposure.<br>
<br>
　do i age regress ? am i part of a community ? am i in a relationship with a "caregiver" ?<br>
<br>
　❣ well, i don't think i really age regress, but i like doing some activities like coloring and making pillowforts... because it's just fun ♡<br>
　❣ as i don't age regress, i am not part of any community. but i really like kidcore and age regression blogs, because they always make me feel so comfortable !<br>
　❣ and, my bf, who i always call bubu ( boo boo, in case you don't know how to pronounce ) is not my caregiver, not in the agere way at least. but he takes good care of me, since i'm very sensitive and i get anxious about complicated "adult stuff", he always helps me a lot, he always makes me feel safe and i love him so much !!! ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
before i finish here, i'd like to say something quick about melanie martinez. everyone knows that there is a direct connection with her and the children's exposure to the famous "daddy kink".<br>
first of all, i would like to say that i particularly really like her instrumentals. but, i think her videos and lyrics a bit... dangerous. some of them are ok, but her most famous songs deal with trauma issues in a not very respectful way, and that really bothers me. i feel uncomfortable about it.<br>
i don't know if she's personally into a kink, and i've never seen her directly exposing kinks to children, so i'm not "against her".<br>
however, i know she's friend of <a title="[ 
yungelita ]" id="linkbjinho">a person</a> who is completely disrespectful to children, who sexualises child abuse, necrophilia, suicide and many other things. i have nothing against melanie in particular, at least for today, but i think she shouldn't have contact with such toxic people.<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope i have made things clear, since this subject is so controversial, it's difficult to write about it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xwdYOki.gif"/><br>
if i said something wrong, please let me know !<br>
i'm open to suggestions, as always, so don't forget my email : <i>letters@middlepot.com</i><br>

the weather is surprisingly hot for an early spring, and even so i'm eating a lot of sweets...<br>
it usually happens on cold days <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7rt3skM.gif"/><br>
the heat makes me pretty lazy, so i'm having trouble keeping my tasks up to date ; ;<br>
i'm trying very hard <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bMpgCel.gif"/><br>
by the way, i'm glad now i can respond everyone properly on the chat !!<br>
hmm, i'll be here probably once a week ? i like to have a week routine and i would not be able to be available on that site every day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BP3dchU.gif"/><br>
<br>
so, here is a very short song that i didn't do recently, but i suddenly found on my things, and i'm so happy because i thought i had lost it forever !!<br>

self diagnosis. deductions based on internet searches are safe ?<br>
i am not against this kind of research, for it's necessary that we know ourselves to seek appropriate help. it is not safe to be silent about our problems.<br>
consulting a professional without being aware of what we feel may result in an uncertain diagnosis. professional help will only be complete with our help, too !<br>
but, it is very important to know that it's completely unsafe to get conclusions about our health without consulting professional help, especially at the time of medication. self medication is something extremely dangerous that can make our problems worse.<br>
<br>
talking about our mental health can be a good thing when it comes to interacting with people because they can hurt us unintentionally. we need to talk about it with people we interact with.<br>
on the internet it has become common for people to make dx lists, to try to stay safe.<br>
there is a serious controversy about this as lots of people use self dx to have the freedom to treat people rudely.<br>
mental illnesses are not justification for doing evil. mental illnesses that affect the personality and make a person have bad attitudes are very serious and should be treated, you know ?<br>
people who use the name of illness to feel more special than others are extremely disrespectful, you should be careful when writing this kind of thing as a way of protection.<br>
<br>
personally, i think dx lists can be dangerous because people are bad and can use it against you.<br>people may think that you are pretending, or try to affect your weaknesses. i think this type of exposure requires caution.<br>
<br>
about me, i can't say i am not neurotypical, because i never had a dx, and i'd rather not do a self dx...
i am searching for it, because i think it's important.<br>
this is what i can say for now :<br>
<br>
ഒ　i am very very sensitive. i don't trust people easily and i don't have many friends, i never had. but i do have some people that i know i can trust, and they make me happy and safe around them. this makes me happy because i consider myself pretty much an introvert.<br>
<br>
ഒ　i do have problems with socializing, and i feel very anxious and i can't breath properly when i'm around lots of unknown people, specially if they are looking at me and if i'm alone. i feel better when i have someone i can really trust with me, but i usually don't put myself in unconfortable situations.<br>
<br>
ഒ　i had some bad experiences at home, i never had a good relationship with my father, he's not a good person. but my mom always made me feel better, she's a good person and i love her.<br>
<br>
ഒ　about some bad experiences i do not have clear memories. sometimes in bad situations, i lost consciousness. from time to time i have bad dreams about uncomfortable experiences. even though they happened many years ago, they always seem to be in my memory, and i hate it.<br>
<br>
i deal with these problems avoiding situations that make me uncomfortable.<br>
since i work and study at home and i have no contact with my father, i don't have much problems anymore.<br>
still, the fear is sometimes very strong because i feel i can by accident find him out there, or that people can force me to stay in uncomfortable situations, just by myself.<br>
i try to take care of myself the best i can. i hope to get a dx soon, because i feel it can help me to cope.
<br>
<br>
well, that's it !<br>
i wouldn't like to receive messages about the situations i mentioned, or deductions about my health, because i think it would be uncomfortable... thank you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/036DTpE.gif"/><br>
i hope this post has helped someone <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oG7ZHYe.gif"/><br>

i received an interesting question by email from a person who was wondering which tool i use to test html.<br>
well, i've always been used to testing html directly on the internet, because there were lots of sites with "html testers". after observing some, I was able to create my own "html tester" which consists of a very simple code !<br>
i realized that nowadays this is not very common, so, since it's very cute and functional, i think it would be nice to show you :<br>
<br>

it's basically a text box where you put the code, and when testing, it opens a popup with the result <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5cKIlPT.gif"/><br>
<br>
so let's get down to the today's subject, which i think some people can identify with :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
if you've been with me for some time on the internet, you must have realized that i rarely post selfies and even more rarely take pictures with other people.<br>
people who know me in person know the reasons, but i'd like to say here today because i think it might be interesting for some people who feel the same way !<br>
<br>
i don't like taking pictures, and i would not say insecurity it's my case, since i do not usually have problems with my appearance, i actually like it most of the time.<br>
it's kind of irrational, to be honest. i really don't like taking photos. i feel extremely uncomfortable with cameras, even with people looking at me, but with cameras it's especially uncomfortable, in a way that i can't explain ; ;<br>
when other people have a camera, i feel really bad and refuse to take pictures. people don't always respect that and keep insisting, but i flee from the situation whenever i can.<br>
the only person i don't feel so uncomfortable taking pictures of me is my mom, even because she always asks if she can, and doesn't show the pictures around without my permission.<br>
it doesn't mean that i don't like being with people, that i don't have friends, that i don't leave home, or anything like that. i just don't like taking pictures, and i wish people would respect that !!<br>
<br>
when i'm taking a picture myself, i don't feel so bad, and sometimes i feel in the mood. it's rare, but it happens. usually these moments happen the night before bed, or after waking up. i don't know why, i think i just feel comfy in my pajamas at home, and i pick up my phone at the moment ...<br>
yes, that's why i take pictures on pajamas.<br>
i actually have 2 or 3 of each pajama, and since idk, 2015, i took some pictures using the same ones LOL<br>
i'm always posting the pictures in different dates but some of them was taked on the same day. anyway, it was like, 5 different days of pictures i took with the SAME PAJAMAS<br>
it was not on purpose, of course. actually i have lots of pajamas, because i love pajamas. i change pajamas almost everyday... the thing is, i usualy have 2 or 3 of each because my mom is a semstress and buy fabric in big amont, and it's cute fabric, so i like to have identical pajamas because who cares ? i'm at home, i can use my favorites for longer this way, you know ? that's why my pajamas stay good even before years.<br>
<br>
i feel a little childish about these things, like, i don't prepare myself to take pictures and i have identical pajamas and i took lots of pictures with the same ones and don't even notice ;///;<br>
i hope it's not so weird, i have a theory : i think i take pictures with the same pajamas because i feel i look better with these, and when i'm with other ones i don't feel so ok to take pictures. it makes sense for me because i really like these, they are some of my favorites. unconsciously i feel super comfy with these and, take pictures.<br>
i think that's okay, it's hard for me to feel comfortable with cameras, if i was thinking so much about my clothes, hairstyle, makeup and everything, i would be so nervous ; ;<br>
<br>
hmnfg, maybe it's a little annoying to see similar photos all the time, and if it's really annoying, you can tell me !<br>
because about hairstyle, makeup, angles.. i'm not changing things. i don't work with my appearance or anything... i don't see why i would change my way to take pictures, you know ? it's just a little little thing for me, i don't take this serious, so please don't take this serious too. that's why i don't post selfies on the blog, or on social media, i would be really annoying to see the same face with same everything all the time, right ? i'm just still doing it because sooometimes i feel in the mood. i like to wear different clothes, to do hairstyles, using accessories, i'm indeed not really a fan of makeup, but none of that makes me want to take selfies, anyway. i do not like to show my face in photos, i feel shy, even when i feel cute.<br>
i want to take some pictures of my looks, clothes that i wear, but selfies, still rarely. i just don't feel like it.
so i'm still going to take selfies with pajamas, and sometimes the same ones, yep, the same hair too, and no makeup, because at least for now i feel good this way ! it's my way of feeling comfortable enough to take pictures from time to time ; ;<br>
<br>
i hope you understand !!<br>
and i hope it has not been so confused, because it's hard to express nonsense feelings <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Awsg3L5.gif"/><br>
that's it !<br>

<br>
so, let's get down to the subject i want to talk about :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
in tumblr, it's very common to see specifications of what kind of aesthetics and content you post and what kind of people you accept interaction with. some of you are curious about my specifications and ask in my tumblr, which is related to my main facebook page too, since the aesthetics are similar.<br>
so here i am to clarify some things about the aesthetics that i post on my main tumblr, and what kind of blogs i usually follow and interact :<br>
<br>
♡　i usually follow blogs with kidcore, nostalgia, 2000s aesthetics, cleancore, cute graphics, vintage stuff, anything that is comfy and cute for me, because i make my blog a safe space.<br>
<br>
♡　my tumblr is not a kin blog nor an age regression blog and i am not part of any community, but i interact with age regression blogs from sfw communities. i don't usually interact or accept interactions with kink blogs, because these people can be dangerous.<br>
<br>
♡　sometimes, i follow trauma blogs. they have negative content from time to time and even nsfw content, but i don't usually interact with that kind of content, just the posts i consider related to what i'm feeling at the moment. trauma blogs sometimes make me feel comfortable and helps me deal with bad memories.<br>
<br>
♡　i interact and follow blogs with nudity, usually renaissance paintings, which i love so much ! i don't interact with porn blogs, and i usually block the ones i consider wrong.<br>
<br>
♡　i consider my blog really sfw, unless you consider artistic nudity and some small bruises nsfw. in this case, i'm really really sorry, but i don't use tags, because it would be so stressful and time-consuming for me. so please be careful about body image, gifs, bruises, religious images, medicine, bugs, dolls and other triggers. everything i've quoted is posted cautiously and infrequently + my blog is drama-free !<br>
<br>
<br>
i think this is enough to clarify your doubts !<br>
about self diagnostic, kinks and other controversial issues, i'll talk about it in the near future.<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/okI5O5E.gif"/><br>
i'm extremely happy with the progress of this site, you seem to be enjoying it a lot ; ;<br>
as you seem to be still exploring the site, new content will be added to the pages gradually.<br>
at the moment i'm dealing with the shy bunny store preparations ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gmXpcA2.gif"/><br>
many items are being made, but i want them to be a surprise so i'll keep it a secret for now. after the store's announcement, new items will always be shown here !<br>
by the way, i'm really sorry for the store being only available to my country. this is because export rates are too high to the point of making sales nearly impossible <img width="15px" height="auto" src="https://i.imgur.com/kYbRfZV.gif"/><br>
in the future i promise that i will find a solution to this problem, as i intend to bring my items to you all !<br>
<br>
so, i think it would be nice to let you know that i've changed the layout of my <a href="https://dulci-chu.my.to" id="linkbjinho" target="_blank">main tumblr</a> !<br>
take a look :<br>

did you like it ?<br>
since we are talking about this project, there is something very important that i would like to answer in this post !<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
why do i use the word "loli" ?<br>
i feel it's very important to talk about the meanings of that word, and also of "nymph". it has become a taboo to use these words, and since ever, the lolita (ロリータ) fashion has been bothered by the other meanings of that word.<br>
recently, things like "nymphet aesthetic" are popping up. where do these words come from ?<br>
are these things connected ?<br>
<br>
so, beginning with loli, which is the abbreviation for lolita :<br>
it is impossible to know where the word lolita really came from. well before Nabokov, even Lewis Carrol already used that word.<br>
some people say it's just a nickname for lola, and that's it. it's a name, indeed.<br>
but not just a name, it has become a word full of meanings.<br>
i was able to gather 3 main meanings for this word, which can clarify some things for you all :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　loli/ta : a cute little girl, pure and innocent. this meaning has absolutely no sexual connotation. it's the meaning i use to describe adorable little girls. it's very probably the meaning that was the basis for lolita (ロリータ) fashion, although it is not intended for little girls, the silhouette is based on the clothes of little girls of the Victorian and Rococo eras, especially in some sub-styles, like the sweet loli.<br>
　Ⅱ.　loli/ta : a girl who looks younger than she really is, like a little girl, in appearance, or personality. this meaning was sometimes used in age regression and gave rise to a type of fashion related to age regression. however, despite being an adjective without sexual connotation, it is often used sexually in the pornographic industry and among kinksters. because of this, became a dangerous term and stopped being used in safe communities.<br>
related to this meaning, there is also :<br>
　　　　　lolicon / lolita complex : a person who is attracted to girls who look like little girls. obviously this is very questionable, but not necessarily linked to pedophilia. not yet.<br>
　Ⅲ.　loli/ta : a little girl, prepubescent or adolescent girl who is attractive and sexually responsive, sexually precocious. now, that meaning, is what really makes it all so dark. and related :<br>
　　　　　lolicon / lolita complex : a person who is attracted to little girls. basically, a pedophile.<br>
<br>
<b>important :</b> i don't know the origins of the word "shota", but it's the equivalent for boys, in all cases above.<br>
<br><br>
now, the word nymph, which is the abbreviation for nymphet :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　nymph/et : mythological creatures, close to the fairies. conceived of as beautiful maidens inhabiting the sea, rivers, woods, trees, mountains, meadows, and frequently mentioned as attending a superior deity. this meaning has no sexual connotation.<br>
　Ⅱ.　nymph/et : a beautiful or graceful young woman, a maiden, or a marriageable young woman.<br>
　Ⅲ.　nymph/et : an attractive and sexually mature young girl. due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women freely and without care, the term is often related to women who are perceived as behaving similarly. related, there's the term nymphomania that was created by modern psychology as referring to a "desire to engage in human sexual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant", nymphomaniac being the person suffering from such a disorder. in this case, the term "faunlet" is the equivalent for boys.<br>
<br><br>
so, as you can see, those words can be used without sexual connotation, but because of the other meanings, they become rather dangerous words. it is not safe to use them as tags for example, as they may attract bad people. you must be careful when using these terms, but it is possible, and it is not wrong. please, be careful ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oGcmE1L.gif"/><br><br>
and as you already must be thinking, yes, there are some similar stuff and related subjects that i will talk about in future posts, because they are also very important :<br>
　ddlg, age play & melanie martinez ;<br>
　serial killer worshiping & nicole dollanganger ;<br>
　self-diagnostic & trauma blogs ...<br><br>
( don't worry, i'm not going to be mean to anyone here, these are just interesting topics to talk about )
<br><br>
that's it !<br>
i hope you enjoyed this post <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dsfjv9n.gif"/><br>

<br>
hiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4G4Nwoa.gif"/><br>
middlepot.com is finally active, after a long year of preparation ; ;<br>
obviously this is too long time for creating such a simple layout, but the biggest problem was the college, which took up a lot of my time <img src="https://i.imgur.com/r02Ljqm.gif"/><br>
you are probably here because of my projects, where i shared this brand new website !!<br>
this layout was inspired by sites from the 2000s that i liked to visit, did you like it ?<br>
i'm going to change it from time to time !<br>
don't forget to look every little corner here, because there are so many pages !<br>
i want to create more interactive content in the future because i love web design and interactive websites. i have lots of plans !<br>
i want to make this site useful and fun for everyone, so please don't forget to leave your opinions and suggestions in the chat.<br>
<br>
hm, the projects are up to date, but the portfolio is not making me very happy.<br>
it was great to create one because i could see how i need to improve on things that i'm interested in doing <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9ZdvfHg.gif"/><br>
it's hard to focus on so many things, but i like to fill my time doing nice stuff !<br>
i will be updating the projects every week, but i will tell you all the updates here in this blog.<br>
by the way, i'll post a little thing riiiiiight now :<br>

hmnfg i have not done much of painting ;///;<br>
and it's been a long time since you saw a drawing i painted, right ?<br>
but now you will have many new things to see on this site !<br>
i'm so excited !!!!! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/k1JSTp1.gif"/><br>
<br><br>
so, let's talk about something very important, which are the rules of the chat :<br>
・ i use a tiny image as avatar for quick identification. you shouldn't use an avatar, because it would be confusing for everyone. if you want to link images please post in imgur.com and put the link properly, according to the "help" ;<br>
・ it is preferable not to use personal links because you may be blocked by spam. in fact, avoid anything that can be identified as spam, be as clean as possible ;<br>
・ please use clear language and do not speak in languages ​​other than english for a long conversation. i will answer, but predictably use english ;<br>
・ you can ask questions about what you want, and i will select every week an interesting and complex topic to answer in a q&a, because i like to discuss interesting subjects with you, and mainly clarify any doubts ;<br>
・ i'll block who pretend to be someone else ( i can see your ip ), who post nsfw content without warning and who say extremely rude and uncomfortable things ;<br>
・ this chat doesn't have the capacity to receive messages in large quantity, which is good, because i like to read everything and respond appropriately. if your message is not sent, you can try again at another time or send me an email ( letters@middlepot.com )<br>
<br><br>
for now, that's it !<br>
see you in the next post, with the first q&a.<br>
