<font color="#d8b9af">　( august . 31 . 2017 + january . 04 . 2018 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
it's very common to see specifications of what kind of aesthetics and content you post and what kind of people you accept interaction with. some of you are curious about my specifications and ask in my tumblr, which is related to my main facebook page too, since the aesthetics are similar.<br>
so here i am to clarify some things about the aesthetics that i post on my main tumblr, and what kind of blogs i usually follow and interact :<br>
<br>
♡　i usually reblog babycore, angelcore, teddycore, webcore, lovecore, cleancore + all kind of nostalgia & vintage stuff ( anything that is comfy and cute for me, because i make my blog a safe space ). i don't tag aesthetics, but everything is really organized and matching so i think tagging is unnecessary.<br>
<br>
♡　my tumblr is not a kin blog nor an age regression blog and i am not part of any community, but i interact with age regression blogs from sfw communities. i don't usually interact or accept interactions with kink blogs, because these people can be dangerous.<br>
<br>
♡　sometimes, i follow trauma blogs. they have negative content from time to time and even nsfw content, but i don't usually interact with that kind of content, just the posts i consider related to what i'm feeling at the moment. trauma blogs sometimes make me feel comfortable and helps me deal with bad memories.<br>
<br>
♡　i interact and follow blogs with nudity, usually renaissance paintings, which i love so much ! i don't interact with porn blogs, and i usually block the ones i consider wrong.<br>
<br>
♡　i consider my blog really sfw, unless you consider renaissance paintings and some small bruises nsfw. in this case, i'm really really sorry, but i don't use tags, because it would be so stressful and time-consuming for me. so please be careful about body image, gifs, bruises, religious images, medicine, bugs, dolls and other triggers. everything i've quoted is posted cautiously and infrequently + my blog is drama-free !<br>
<br>
♡　i can't do personal posts because it would be extremely uncomfy for me, i just post personal stuff here on my website !!<br>
<br>
♡　i'm sorry, but i really can't reblog promos or do ask / tag games ( i just don't want my blog to be very personal, sorry /// you all are so lovely ; ; ) but it really warms my heart when people tag me in all kind of cute stuff, please feel free to send me everything you think i would like.<br>
<br>
♡　i can't pay attention to every single interaction, but i try my best to make sure i never reblog from bad people. if i interact with someone who is really toxic please tell me quickly, this is very important to me.<br>
<br>
♡　you are free to unfollow me, softblock to break mutuals or just hardblock me ! i just want you to be comfortable.<br>
<br>
♡　i always always read links and i interact with most personal posts i see, sometimes i can't because i'm too shy, i'm sorry ; ;<br>
<br>
♡　i absolutely love all my mutuals !!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
i think this is enough to clarify your doubts !

<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuXKSIc.gif"></sub></sub><font color="#c4afa8">　what are the rules for using the chats ?</font><br><br><br>
<font color="#d8b9af">　( august . 18 . 2017 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
i have two chats currently on this site, which are hosted by cbox. i have some rules of use for them :<br>
・ i use a tiny image as avatar for quick identification. you shouldn't use an avatar, because it would be confusing for everyone. if you want to link images please post in imgur.com and put the link properly, according to the "help" ;<br>
・ it is preferable not to use personal links because you may be blocked by spam. in fact, avoid anything that can be identified as spam, be as clean as possible ;<br>
・ please use clear language and do not speak in languages ​​other than english for a long conversation. i will answer, but predictably use english ;<br>
・ you can ask questions about what you want, and i will select every week an interesting and complex topic to answer in a q&a, because i like to discuss interesting subjects with you, and mainly clarify any doubts ;<br>
・ i'll block who pretend to be someone else ( i can see your ip ), who post nsfw content without warning and who say extremely rude and uncomfortable things ;<br>
・ this chat doesn't have the capacity to receive messages in large quantity, which is good, because i like to read everything and respond appropriately. if your message is not sent, you can try again at another time or send me an email ( letters@middlepot.com )<br>
・ i disable the chat normally because i feel anxious to leave it open when i'm not observing, so if you receive a "closed chat" message, that's why, just try later ! thank you for the patience ♡<br>

<font color="#d8b9af">　( september . 15 . 2017 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
self diagnosis, deductions based on internet searches are safe ?<br>
i am not against this kind of research, for it's necessary that we know ourselves to seek appropriate help. it is not safe to be silent about our problems.<br>
consulting a professional without being aware of what we feel may result in an uncertain diagnosis. professional help will only be complete with our help, too !<br>
but, it is very important to know that it's completely unsafe to get conclusions about our health without consulting professional help, especially at the time of medication. self medication is something extremely dangerous that can make our problems worse.<br>
<br>
talking about our mental health can be a good thing when it comes to interacting with people because they can hurt us unintentionally. we need to talk about it with people we interact with.<br>
on the internet it has become common for people to make dx lists, to try to stay safe.<br>
there is a serious controversy about this as lots of people use self dx to have the freedom to treat people rudely.<br>
mental illnesses are not justification for doing evil. mental illnesses that affect the personality and make a person have bad attitudes are very serious and should be treated, you know ?<br>
people who use the name of illness to feel more special than others are extremely disrespectful, you should be careful when writing this kind of thing as a way of protection.<br>
<br>
personally, i think dx lists can be dangerous because people are bad and can use it against you.<br>people may think that you are pretending, or try to affect your weaknesses. i think this type of exposure requires caution.<br>
<br>
about me, i can't say i am not neurotypical, because i never had a dx, and i'd rather not do a self dx...
i am searching for it, because i think it's important.<br>
this is what i can say for now :<br>
<br>
ഒ　i am very very sensitive. i don't trust people easily and i don't have many friends, i never had. but i do have some people that i know i can trust, and they make me happy and safe around them. this makes me happy because i consider myself pretty much an introvert.<br>
<br>
ഒ　i do have problems with socializing, and i feel very anxious and i can't breath properly when i'm around lots of unknown people, specially if they are looking at me and if i'm alone. i feel better when i have someone i can really trust with me, but i usually don't put myself in unconfortable situations.<br>
<br>
ഒ　i had some bad experiences at home, i never had a good relationship with my father, he's not a good person. but my mom always made me feel better, she's a good person and i love her.<br>
<br>
ഒ　about some bad experiences i do not have clear memories. sometimes in bad situations, i lost consciousness. from time to time i have bad dreams about uncomfortable experiences. even though they happened many years ago, they always seem to be in my memory, and i hate it.<br>
<br>
i deal with these problems avoiding situations that make me uncomfortable.<br>
since i work and study at home and i have no contact with my father, i don't have much problems anymore.<br>
still, the fear is sometimes very strong because i feel i can by accident find him out there, or that people can force me to stay in uncomfortable situations, just by myself.<br>
i try to take care of myself the best i can. i hope to get a dx soon, because i feel it can help me to cope.

<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
age play, ddlg / cgl, there is a fine line between pedophilia and those kinks. how to identify dangerous situations, dangerous people, what's the limit ?<br>
i think the sex life between two adults, responsible for themselves, with consent, is something that allows things like kinks or lifestyles such as bdsm. any sub/dom relationship, have no relation whatsoever to incest or pedophilia. is something consented between two adults. anyway, it's a kink. in my opinion, kinks should in no way be publicly exposed, on the streets or on the internet, where children can see and be influenced. children can't have contact with these kind of things because it wouldn't be healthy.<br>
this unfortunately is something that has happened very often, and even worse, added to age play : ddlg / cgl has reached many minors and many adult pedophiles have had contact with these children through kink communities.<br>
these communities have become increasingly dangerous for minors, through the romanticization of pedophilia, child abuse and contact with kinks linked to childhood. even people who claim to be in a sfw ddlg / cgl community are not safe and are exposed to dangerous people as they use kink tags.<br>
communities of age regression that work hard to be a truly safe environment for people who don't use the agere as something sexual, are  anti ddlg. many people have gone against this kink, because of exposure to minors. it has become something horrible and manipulative.<br>
<br>
i agree that it is really very dangerous to associate childhood with sexuality, even if those involved are adults, and i firmly believe that kinks shouldn't be publicly exposed for children to see. neither of them.<br>
the only way to keep a kink safe and not harmful to anyone is without public exposure.<br>
<br>
　do i age regress ? am i part of a community ? am i in a relationship with a "caregiver" ?<br>
<br>
　❣ well, i don't think i really age regress, but i like doing some activities like coloring and making pillowforts... because it's just fun ♡<br>
　❣ as i don't age regress, i am not part of any community. but i really like kidcore and age regression blogs, because they always make me feel so comfortable !<br>
　❣ and, my bf, who i always call bubu ( boo boo, in case you don't know how to pronounce ) is not my caregiver, not in the agere way at least. but he takes good care of me, since i'm very sensitive and i get anxious about complicated "adult stuff", he always helps me a lot, he always makes me feel safe and i love him so much !!! ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
before i finish here, i'd like to say something quick about melanie martinez. everyone knows that there is a direct connection with her and the children's exposure to the famous "daddy kink".<br>
first of all, i would like to say that i particularly really like her instrumentals. but, i think her videos and lyrics a bit... dangerous. some of them are ok, but her most famous songs deal with trauma issues in a not very respectful way, and that really bothers me. i feel uncomfortable about it.<br>
i don't know if she's personally into a kink, and i've never seen her directly exposing kinks to children, so i'm not "against her".<br>
however, i know she's friend of <a title="[ yungelita ]" id="linkbjinho">a person</a> who is completely disrespectful to children, who sexualises child abuse, necrophilia, suicide and many other things. <s>i have nothing against melanie in particular, at least for today, but</s> i think she shouldn't have contact with such toxic people.<br>
<b>edit //</b> i do have something against melanie now, she is confirmed to be really toxic too and i do not support her at all. i still like the instrumentals, though ; ;<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope i have made things clear, since this subject is so controversial, it's difficult to write about it<br>
if i said something wrong, please let me know !

<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuXKSIc.gif"></sub></sub><font color="#c4afa8">　why do i use the word "loli" ?</font><br><br><br>
<font color="#d8b9af">　( august . 24 . 2017 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
i feel it's very important to talk about the meanings of that word, and also of "nymph". it has become a taboo to use these words, and since ever, the lolita (ロリータ) fashion has been bothered by the other meanings of that word.<br>
recently, things like "nymphet aesthetic" are popping up. where do these words come from ?<br>
are these things connected ?<br>
<br>
so, beginning with loli, which is the abbreviation for lolita :<br>
it is impossible to know where the word lolita really came from. well before Nabokov, even Lewis Carrol already used that word.<br>
some people say it's just a nickname for lola, and that's it. it's a name, indeed.<br>
but not just a name, it has become a word full of meanings.<br>
i was able to gather 3 main meanings for this word, which can clarify some things for you all :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　loli/ta : a cute little girl, pure and innocent. this meaning has absolutely no sexual connotation. it's the meaning i use to describe adorable little girls. it's very probably the meaning that was the basis for lolita (ロリータ) fashion, although it is not intended for little girls, the silhouette is based on the clothes of little girls of the Victorian and Rococo eras, especially in some sub-styles, like the sweet loli.<br>
　Ⅱ.　loli/ta : a girl who looks younger than she really is, like a little girl, in appearance, or personality. this meaning was sometimes used in age regression and gave rise to a type of fashion related to age regression. however, despite being an adjective without sexual connotation, it is often used sexually in the pornographic industry and among kinksters. because of this, became a dangerous term and stopped being used in safe communities.<br>
related to this meaning, there is also :<br>
　　　　　lolicon / lolita complex : a person who is attracted to girls who look like little girls. obviously this is very questionable, but not necessarily linked to pedophilia. not yet.<br>
　Ⅲ.　loli/ta : a little girl, prepubescent or adolescent girl who is attractive and sexually responsive, sexually precocious. now, that meaning, is what really makes it all so dark. and related :<br>
　　　　　lolicon / lolita complex : a person who is attracted to little girls. basically, a pedophile.<br>
<br>
<b>important :</b> i don't know the origins of the word "shota", but it's the equivalent for boys, in all cases above.<br>
<br><br>
now, the word nymph, which is the abbreviation for nymphet :<br>
<br>
　Ⅰ.　nymph/et : mythological creatures, close to the fairies. conceived of as beautiful maidens inhabiting the sea, rivers, woods, trees, mountains, meadows, and frequently mentioned as attending a superior deity. this meaning has no sexual connotation.<br>
　Ⅱ.　nymph/et : a beautiful or graceful young woman, a maiden, or a marriageable young woman.<br>
　Ⅲ.　nymph/et : an attractive and sexually mature young girl. due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women freely and without care, the term is often related to women who are perceived as behaving similarly. related, there's the term nymphomania that was created by modern psychology as referring to a "desire to engage in human sexual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant", nymphomaniac being the person suffering from such a disorder. in this case, the term "faunlet" is the equivalent for boys.<br>
<br><br>
so, as you can see, those words can be used without sexual connotation, but because of the other meanings, they become rather dangerous words. it is not safe to use them as tags for example, as they may attract bad people. you must be careful when using these terms, but it is possible, and it is not wrong. please, be careful !

<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuXKSIc.gif"></sub></sub><font color="#c4afa8">　how was my past on the internet ?</font><br><br><br>
<font color="#d8b9af">　( october . 21 . 2017 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
what did i do on the internet before starting the projects and this website ?<br>
some of you have known me for quite some time because i played many online games, especially dress up games and ragnarok. i'm not going to get into this because i already have the gaming session, where you can check it out !<br>
i started with the internet very early, i was only 7 years old ( 2004 ). my mom always saw everything i did, so it was safe, don't worry LOL<br>
i used to play flash games, and i had msn, and a blog. everyone had blogs or personal websites on the internet, where they customized and posted all sorts of things. i was a kid so i was not good with those things, but i liked to post gifs with cute animals, lots of glitter and beautiful images that i found on other blogs and google.<br>
i didn't have social media at the time because i was very young and my mom wouldn't let me. i enjoyed visiting lots of websites with graphics and materials, beautiful blogs, and playing online games. my first online game was ragnarok, and my second, club penguin, if you wanna know.<br>
i only used the internet for 2 hours a day in the morning and i used this time to decorate my blog and play with my friends. it was so much fun and i have great memories of that time !<br>
i could have a social media ( orkut ) with 9 y/o, and i continued just posting cute graphics with lots of glitter, because it's just so adorable !<br>
i also knew several forums at that time, and began to communicate with people all over the world. my english was obviously horrible, but i used the google translator to help me. i never posted any real information or photo because i was taught that this is dangerous.<br>
i did several blogs, which were improving the quality of content and the layouts were becoming cuter. in 2006, i did the <a id="linkbjinho" data-target="spoiler1" class="btn-spoiler">first layout</a> that i really was very proud of !<br>

over time, the internet has been changing ... the blogs became unpopular, forums too, msn died, orkut died ... very sad, right ? ;-;<br>
i then looked for substitutes for the things i liked : i tried using facebook to replace orkut, but no one else cared about the glittery cute things and i was disappointed.<br>
i started using tumblr, which was well customizable and could fill the void that blogs left behind. it worked, even if it took a long time to find an aesthetic that would make me really happy, so i did several blogs until i got to my recent one ( it was during this time that i created the name middlepot ).<br>
my recent one, was done together with a friend of mine, who also made with me the not bad fb page, which should have the same aesthetics. but she and i had very different opinions of what we wanted to do and she'd post things that i didn't like, both on the tumblr and on the page ... it became a mess, and we ended up giving up doing it together. i'd like to talk more about it in another post, because it's a tricky subject ; ;<br>
anyway, i deleted her posts from tumblr and facebook, and then i got to what it is today : a safe and comfy place !<br>
the fb pages have similar content, which i get on tumblr. in this way, fb pages are extensions of my main tumblr, a way to bring content to people who don't know it.<br>
fb itself, i did not like to use as a social media. i also tried using instagram, but bad things happened and i gave up on it too. i'm used to the more open and customizable format the old internet had, so the tumblr was the place where i most adapted.<br>
to replace the forums, i found other places on the internet where i could communicate with various types of people, where i always remain anonymous as usual.<br>
to replace msn, which was the platform i always used to talk to my family and close friends, i decided to use line. line in my opinion resembles quite a lot of things, besides having super cute stickers and themes !!<br>
<br>
but in spite of having tumblr ( and fb pages ), other nice places on the internet & the cute line... i was still missing something, my little corner on internet, to be able to make layouts exactly as i imaginate & post every kind of things i want : a personal website !!<br>
so i did it, and here i am ♡ . * ･ ｡<br>
the 7 y/o me would be really proud of everything i'm doing right now. this website is really my favorite place on internet !<br>
it's all i wanted, here i can put together all the projects i do and all the content i like.<br>
<br>
<br>
i hope this answers a few things about how i got here ! <br>
and i wrote a lot, i hope it's not tiring to read ; ;

<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuXKSIc.gif"></sub></sub><font color="#c4afa8">　why can't i post lots of selfies ?</font><br><br><br>
<font color="#d8b9af">　( september . 08 . 2017 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
if you've been with me for some time on the internet, you must have realized that i rarely post selfies and even more rarely take pictures with other people.<br>
people who know me in person know the reasons, but i'd like to say here today because i think it might be interesting for some people who feel the same way !<br>
<br>
i don't like taking pictures, and i would not say insecurity it's my case, since i do not usually have problems with my appearance, i actually like it most of the time.<br>
it's kind of irrational, to be honest. i really don't like taking photos. i feel extremely uncomfortable with cameras, even with people looking at me, but with cameras it's especially uncomfortable, in a way that i can't explain ; ;<br>
when other people have a camera, i feel really bad and refuse to take pictures. people don't always respect that and keep insisting, but i flee from the situation whenever i can.<br>
the only person i don't feel so uncomfortable taking pictures of me is my mom, even because she always asks if she can, and doesn't show the pictures around without my permission.<br>
it doesn't mean that i don't like being with people, that i don't have friends, that i don't leave home, or anything like that. i just don't like taking pictures, and i wish people would respect that !!<br>
<br>
when i'm taking a picture myself, i don't feel so bad, and sometimes i feel in the mood. it's rare, but it happens. usually these moments happen the night before bed, or after waking up. i don't know why, i think i just feel comfy in my pajamas at home, and i pick up my phone at the moment ...<br>
yes, that's why i take pictures on pajamas.<br>
i actually have 2 or 3 of each pajama, and since idk, 2015, i took some pictures using the same ones LOL<br>
i'm always posting the pictures in different dates but some of them was taked on the same day. anyway, it was like, 5 different days of pictures i took with the SAME PAJAMAS<br>
it was not on purpose, of course. actually i have lots of pajamas, because i love pajamas. i change pajamas almost everyday... the thing is, i usualy have 2 or 3 of each because my mom is a semstress and buy fabric in big amont, and it's cute fabric, so i like to have identical pajamas because who cares ? i'm at home, i can use my favorites for longer this way, you know ? that's why my pajamas stay good even before years.<br>
<br>
i feel a little childish about these things, like, i don't prepare myself to take pictures and i have identical pajamas and i took lots of pictures with the same ones and don't even notice ;///;<br>
i hope it's not so weird, i have a theory : i think i take pictures with the same pajamas because i feel i look better with these, and when i'm with other ones i don't feel so ok to take pictures. it makes sense for me because i really like these, they are some of my favorites. unconsciously i feel super comfy with these and, take pictures.<br>
i think that's okay, it's hard for me to feel comfortable with cameras, if i was thinking so much about my clothes, hairstyle, makeup and everything, i would be so nervous ; ;<br>
<br>
hmnfg, maybe it's a little annoying to see similar photos all the time, and if it's really annoying, you can tell me !<br>
because about hairstyle, makeup, angles.. i'm not changing things. i don't work with my appearance or anything... i don't see why i would change my way to take pictures, you know ? it's just a little little thing for me, i don't take this serious, so please don't take this serious too. that's why i don't post selfies on the blog, or on social media, i would be really annoying to see the same face with same everything all the time, right ? i'm just still doing it because sooometimes i feel in the mood. i like to wear different clothes, to do hairstyles, using accessories, i'm indeed not really a fan of makeup, but none of that makes me want to take selfies, anyway. i do not like to show my face in photos, i feel shy, even when i feel cute.<br>
i want to take some pictures of my looks, clothes that i wear, but selfies, still rarely. i just don't feel like it.
so i'm still going to take selfies with pajamas, and sometimes the same ones, yep, the same hair too, and no makeup, because at least for now i feel good this way ! it's my way of feeling comfortable enough to take pictures from time to time ; ;<br>
<br>
i hope you understand !!

that being said, i don't care at all if you like them too.<br>

<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuXKSIc.gif"></sub></sub><font color="#c4afa8">　why one is not better than the other ?</font><br><br><br>
<font color="#d8b9af">　( december . 20 . 2017 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
i would like to talk about this subject that has bothered me a lot on the internet because people are saying very rude things about each other just like a chain of hate ; ;<br>
this makes me very sad, and i feel that it's important spread positivity about it, although it is complicated to write about, i hope you understand my point.<br>
<br>
( before starting, i would like to point out that in referring to boys and girls i mean the natural female and male sides of people, such as the sexes ! )<br>
<br>
humans are animals, above all else. and animals are born boys or girls, to procreate and fulfill their roles in nature.<br>
human beings are rational animals, so sometimes we are not satisfied with what we're born from. our heart is pure and knows what is best for us, and we must be happy to make others happy.<br>
therefore, we can choose our role in nature ( and society, of course )<br>
but there is something very bad that affects our choices of heart that would make us happy and good : people choose what they are, what they like, their way of living and their roles in society, based on what others think is cool !<br>
this is an impure thought, for we should not change who we truly are only because "it's cool", we must be pure, be ourselves above all else.<br>
there is some kind of odious fashion where it says girls should live with the goal of being better than boys, and vice versa.<br>
and there is also another one that boys have built up today's society alone, and that girls have never helped at all.<br>
this is a very toxic thought that affects our lives and society, we should not be against each other !!<br>
<br>
boys and girls are no better than others, just different. biologically, we have some advantages and disadvantages over the other, but this is natural and there is nothing wrong.<br>
we are like cake and pudding, there is no better or worse, just personal preference !<br>
therefore, we can be who we really want, because our heart knows the right way.<br>
a society works well and happy when everyone is pure, are themselves, and so can fulfill their roles in society, happy and comfortable with their lives !<br>
the role of all people in society is to do good, to spread love and kindness, to bring education and health to others and to be happy. this can be done by all people when they are living stable and comfortable lives!<br>
you don't have to have children or form a family for it, if you don't want to, even if nature has made your body for it. what matters is meeting and knowing who you really are. if you feel confused, you are not happy and you do not make others happy.<br>
if you feel that getting married, having children and caring for the house would make you happy, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, of course !<br>
even if your friends tell you that it would make you dependent and unhappy, does not mean it's true. economic independence is not really independence in life.<br>
people seek a happy society for all through toxic thoughts of superiority. we must work together as a family ! when we are together, the advantages and disadvantages of being a boy or girl does not matter, as they can complement each other in solving problems !<br>
we all have special abilities and unique talents. it may be difficult to find what we want to be and do in our lives, but it's very important that we do not follow the instincts or opinions of others, but the heart, which is who we certainly are.<br>
<br>
<br>
i'm sorry if i wrote many things repeated, i hope you can understand !<br>
i hope this has some good feeling for you, because the internet is full of people fighting over being better than the other and this makes me very upset ...<br>

i have just a little note about this site for you, but i think it's important :<br>
in my little world there is a little free space to talk, but if you already know this site, you know there is a huge amount of people who spam random text and ascii art in any free space you see.<br>
my space is blocked for pasting, which relieves spam a little bit, but there is still a simple script line that allows you to paste in any free space !<br>
i really like this site because i've met some really nice people in it, but the point is : there are lots of immature and dumb people who like to spam random offensive stuff or cursing. i don't really care about that, and i can easily erase that sort of thing ( and i always do it when i have the opportunity ) but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing i suggest you be careful ! take care ♡<br>

<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuXKSIc.gif"></sub></sub><font color="#c4afa8">　why can't i show you my astrology chart ?</font><br><br><br>
<font color="#d8b9af">　( january . 18 . 2018 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
i am very interested in astrology and any other "pseudoscience", as well as personality tests, i usually read a lot about it.<br>
but i honestly don't like to talk about that kind of thing, not a little bit. the reason is that most of the time people think they can know everything about others from small information. this is obviously not true and makes me feel very uncomfortable and dissociated seeing people trying to know things about me without knowing me ! it's almost disrespectful, to be honest.<br>
i will not go into other subjects, i will just talk about astrology here, which is a very good example :<br>
astrology is something very complex. people have birth charts, there are signs for each planet, alignments, houses, many details to study.<br>
astrologers study a lot to learn to correctly interpret and evaluate a birth chart, a very relevant example of how a chart can have diverse interpretations is that twins have identical birth charts, but may have completely different personalities.<br>
each person manifests parts of the chart differently, there is no standard for this. people, even so, make very heavy conclusions about others from just a few details of a person's birth chart. i think this is just so wrong, indeed annoying !<br>
for this reason, i do not like to talk about astrology or other similar subjects with almost anyone, i will not show you my birth chart here ever and i kindly ask you that please don't share stereotyped information about my solar sign with me, this makes me very sad.<br>
<br>
i hope you understand my point !<br>
i don't judge people who identify 100% with their solar signs and like this kind of stereotyped information, it just is not my case and i think it's bad that people don't respect it ..<br>
please be kind to others !!<br>

<font color="#d8b9af">　( february . 15 . 2018 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
there's always a beauty competition between different people, races, species and even non-existencial things, and this is honestly so unhealthy !!<br>
there's even a thing called 2.5D wich is "almost non-real pretty" people. i think the desire of being perfect is normal, but it's also dangerous.<br>
people who know how to be beautiful in their best capacity, as healthy and captivating human beings, are really the ones who manage to be almost non-real, so you don't have to be artificial for it. if you try to be perfect you will fail because it's not possible. don't push the limits, just be yourself ! be the best version of yourself, the best you can be, always.<br>
you can't compare yourself with things you'll never be, it's very unhealthy. everything has totally diferent kind of beauties. 2D characters for example are usually made to be pretty besides they usually are not realistic enough to have the details that normal people have, so it's natural that you wanna be like that too. but we are made by nature itself. everything in nature is different and beautiful in its own way, and so are you. we are part of the nature. you don't have to worry about it, at all, because you don't have to be the perfect pretty to be happy.<br>
i think it's also very important to say that your body don't need to be pretty to keep you healthy and alive, and that's the more important thing ! beauty does not make you a good person, you have to work on it.<br>
beauty exist in many ways, i know it may sound cliché, but the inner beauty will really make you more and more beautiful to everyone, including to yourself.<br>
it's okay if you want to look at the mirror and be pleased, we like beautiful things. but it's not that hard. everyone have beauty parts to look at and feel happy. what people say it's pretty, it's not necessarily true for everyone. a good example is fashion, design and aesthetics : everyone have a different taste, even if it's more common to like some kind of clothes and aesthetics, maybe you like some things that are uncommon. it's the same thing, and that's why everything can be beautiful in some way ! you are beautiful in lots of ways, and if you don't believe it, just try to find things that make you happy about yourself and focus on that things !<br>
there's a special beauty in everyone. you are unique, and the cute features you have are purely luck, that's super special ! also, you can be even prettier if you work on being a better person every day, a perfect version of what it's possible for you to be. for example, there are small things that automatically make us feel more beautiful sometimes ( as fashion and makeup ). the most important thing is to feel comfortable and keep healthy. be proud of your race, your species and your existence. be proud of being you !<br>
<br>
please, think about it, because we usually forget some important points that would make us truly happier !!<br>
be kind to yourself ♡<br>

<font color="#d8b9af">　( march . 15 . 2018 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
since i was free to choose my clothes, i always tried to wear something otome kei, because it was my favorite accessible style, but at the end of the day i was just wearing oversized shirts and sweaters with skirts / shorts and high socks ;///;<br>
( + bell choker + tiny bows at my hair )<br>
pretty much boring, but i wasn't very good with fashion until my 16 at least. i did a lot of research to find a style that really fits me !<br>
<br>
at the moment, i take inspirations from :<br>
<br>
✄ <b>larme kei</b> ( lots of handmade clothes, but i love rose marie seoir and axes femme )<br>
✄ <b>mori girl</b> ( on fall and winter i do wear it a loooooot, so cozy and comfy, lots of handmade clothes too )<br>
✄ <b>cult party</b> ( i have a few coords that I LOVE but i don't wear it a lot, the fabric is just so delicate ; ; )<br>
✄ <b>lolita</b> ( i don't have any coord yet so it's basically à la mode. my dream is to wear classical-sweet, it's hard to wear on non-special occasions, but i think i can adapt to casual. i'm studying this style for YEARS i love it )<br>
✄ <b>himekaji</b> ( basicaly because of liz lisa, cliché, i know )<br>
<br>
✁ & in everyday situations i'm inspired by that soft and clean aesthetic clothes ( not very creative but it's cute ) ✃<br>
<br>
so, i know lolita since i was 13 and i study lolita since i was 16. but why i don't use it YET ?<br>
i sincerely think that at this point i know how to coordinate, i don't think lolita is too hard, it just have many rules and you need a lot of study, help and research. as i said, i have been studying for many years, so i think i'm okay with lolita to make a good first outfit now.<br>
um, i don't have many items that i can use with lolita right now, and i also know that i don't need lots of money to buy good lolita clothes. i have no problem with handmade and non-brand outfits, because i know it's very possible to have a super cute and high quality lolita outfit, full handmade. as you may know, i love handmade outfits and most of my clothes are handmade.<br>
but about lolita, specificly .. i know it's dumb, but i have a big wish :<br>
i need a full angelic pretty outfit.<br>
and that's not because i'm insecure about non-brand clothes, i just love angelic pretty too much and i need my first outfit to be super special for me. i don't care if it's expensive or anything, i just think it would be perfect to have a classical-sweet outfit, super high quality and from my favorite brand.<br>
because it's expensive, i'm waiting for money. it can be silly, but it's really really special to me to have my first outfit from angelic pretty.<br>
also, i really want outfits from innocent world and baby, i really love those brands and i will feel complete when i start with lolita supporting them.<br>
after that, i'll probably coordinate brand clothes with handmade clothes, i think i can do that, and i think it will be magical ! i can't wait ...<br>

<font color="#d8b9af">　( april . 05 . 2018 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
the sexualization is a very controversial subject. it can be seen as horrible, beautiful, okay, or even as an art form. it can be beautiful, but it can also be dangerous. there is a fine line between healthy and unhealthy sexuality, which causes people to be often completely in favor or against. i think there are big limits to it.<br>
sexual content and pornography is very dangerous because often this industry involves people being harmed and abused, and make sex seem vulgar and casual. this becomes an addiction and is totally wrong, it ruins you, makes you have a lot of problems and mess up your whole life !!<br>
this goes a long way from kinks and different forms of sexuality, it's about self-respect, safety, happiness, purity and health.<br>
i personally consider that people who are involved with pornography and prostitution ( even on the internet ) are often source of many problems, for themselves and for many others ( even children ) and i totally do not support this industry. i am not exactly against drawings and animations, for they are not real people ( when it comes especially to art, i support quite as well as artistic nudity in any case ). but, this type of content still has moral limits and should be reserved for adults, always.<br>
puberty is the time when we should be very careful about sexuality, because it is not the moment to do it, but it's natural to be curious and very important to be educated about it. repressed sexuality is often degenerate. many children at puberty become hypersexualized and even not having sex, come very close to it several times and with several different people. they can often develop weird kinks and even support pedophilia. they get hurt and traumatized for a lifetime, even hurting other people in the process.<br>
<br>
the excessive sexualization can bring hypersexualization to people, which is very dangerous for their lives.<br>
the sex itself is not impure, since we're animals and it's healthy and natural to have sexuality.<br>
but sex is not only for having babies but also for pleasure. this is when it gets dangerous.<br>
using food as an example : there are delicious foods that are healthy and some that are bad for our bodies and even if food is essential for our survival, consuming too much food can destroy our lives. everything has limits.<br>
hypersexuality can lead to need for casual sex, and it is always a problem because the more you do, the more you want to do. this in addition to being able to bring diseases, is dangerous, not healthy and bad for your mind.<br>
this is a major problem of early sexuality, since children do not have a safe way to have sex. it's always wrong, harmful and traumatic for them.<br>
it's very super important that sexuality be brought in a healthy way to make everyone happy. treating it as wrong and dirty does not help in this process !!<br>
the right sex would be not necessarily to make babies, but the one we do healthfully often and only with people we trust. the sex with whom we love is infinitely better and makes you and the other person happy. it doesn't hurt anyone, it doesn't make you sad, it's pure, safe and comfortable. makes you feel loved. there is no way to be something bad !<br>
<br>
so take care of yourselves, please, it will do miracles to your mental health. i promise.<br>
i really hope my words are easy to understand !<br>

❀　i'm very shy & introverted. so, because of my introversion, i don't feel bad for being shy, it's just part of me ;<br>
❀　i'm full of love and i do my best to take care of others and myself. i want to bring comfort and safety to everyone !<br>
❀　i have difficulties in approaching and sometimes i never feel comfortable near some people ;<br>
❀　when i'm comfortable with people, i talk a lot about random things, sometimes i even talk too much ///<br>
❀　i usually adapt to different situations and different people "changing moods", sometimes i get into it a lot and i feel confused, but i'm always myself ;<br>
❀　i'm always evaluating my behavior to improve myself, but sometimes i take it too seriously and get overwhelmed ;<br>
❀　i love rules ! i love to make rules for myself, to have rules made for me and to follow them. rules often make me happy because they make me a better person ;<br>
❀　i make lists all the time to be able to have an organized routine and take time to practice all my hobbies. feeling busy with things that i like makes me feel pretty satisfied !<br>
❀　i think too much about everything and sometimes i feel melancholic ;<br>

<b>edit //</b> some people asked me to post some things about my body as well. i thought a lot about it because it's very intimate and i don't like to post so many things like that ...<br>
but i decided that i'll post, since these are information that anyone who knows me personally would know, there is nothing so secret about it :<br>
<br>
✂　my height is 5,5. average, i guess ?<br>
✂　i weight 117 lbs. i think i'm skinny, but not super skinny, i'm okay.<br>
✂　i don't want to share measurements here, but i really like my body shape ! according to my measures, i'm hourglass figure.<br>
✂　my skin is pale, but not super pale. i hate tanning because my skin is really sensitive and turns red only ; ;<br>
✂　my hair changes color very much according to the lighting, but it also becomes clearer if i go out in the sun. it's dark blond / light brown and sometimes it gets a little bit orange, but it's only noticeable in the sunlight.<br>
✂　i like to keep a "himecut" in my hair, with short side bangs ( it's cute but also a bit more mature than straight bangs ). i cut my hair myself. i'm lazy so it's common for my bangs to be super long + my hair is quite wavy, so the cut is not so noticeable.<br>
✂　my eyes are between blue and green ( cyan, turquoise ) + a little bit grayish.<br>
✂　i don't know my shoe size to be honest, but my feet are 24cm.<br>
✂　um... i'm a-cup ;////;<br>

<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xuXKSIc.gif"></sub></sub><font color="#c4afa8">　what is purity & innocence ?</font><br><br><br>
<font color="#d8b9af">　( may . 04 . 2018 )</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#B1A69E">
i would like to talk about these two adjectives that are so confusing to people : pure & innocent.<br>
these are actually extremely important things, but are treated as something far, almost impossible to achieve. and that's not true, because it's something we can all go back to.<br>
to explain it better, let's define purity and innocence :<br>
purity, as i have already commented in other posts, is something that you are when you're being yourself. when you act naturally and follow your heart, when you do not listen to what others think is good for you, but what your heart says is best for you. your heart wants you to have a clear conscience, want you to stay safe and healthy, wants you to be happy. it's not always the easiest path, but it's always the right one, the pure one. purity is literally not be contaminated by external influences. it's hard because we live in society and we need to please others, but it doesn't mean that you need to change who you are ( not even a little bit ) to be a nice person, and be happy.<br>
innocence is something that people often confuse with ignorance. when you don't know things by choice, you are being ignorant, which is a bad quality. innocence is when you see the world in a beautiful way, when you believe in your dreams, believe things can get better, do not judge others before you know, when even after being bitten by a dog, do not you think all dogs are evil. so, innocence is more linked to positivity, it's a quality of being radiant and full of love, even having gone through difficult things, or not. of course it's easier to be positive when you don't have traumas to deal with, but that's not the point. it is possible, and it is necessary for you to be happy !<br>
children are pure and innocent because they have not been "contaminated" by society's pressure to be different from who they really are, to give up their dreams, to think the world and people are bad and it's always getting worse. this is not right and it's not true. it's a super toxic thought.<br>
other ( nonhuman ) animals are like children forever, for at least none of them still live in society like humans. society itself is not a problem, but people just don't have the maturity to deal with it in a healthy way. it's something that people should educate themselves and educate their children so that we can all be happier !!<br>
never think that you have no hope, that you are dirty or rotten, that your dreams can't come true, that magic doesn't exist. erase it forever from your life !!! learning to evaluating your behavior and the way you see the world is very important to becoming a better and more satisfied person. believe in your dreams, make the little you from the past proud of who you became today ♡ !<br>

i created the page with a friend and the tumblr blog later, in order to improve the content of the page, improving its aesthetics. the problem is that our opinions were very different and she posted things very different from me, so everything was a mess. so far so good, but the biggest problem was that she liked to post things from kink blogs and lots of offensive stuff that i think it's very bad and ruined the page environment completely. our friendship dissolved over time ( not only because of that ) and she decided she didn't want to post on the page or tumblr anymore for lack of time, so i erased all the content that i definitely hate and left everything clean and neat again. posting alone i could have control over the content quality and aesthetics. i hope that everything has been completely deleted, i'm very ashamed of this past. if you find anything, PLEASE let me know !<br>

who knows the not bad page since its beginning remembers that saturday was a day where i posted pictures from followers. the intention was to post beautiful pics that matched the aesthetics of the page, but things didn't go very well.. saturday became a very annoying day, people only sent super edited selfies and poor quality pics, even super inappropriate ones. and if i didn't post those pics, people would get really mad at me and keep spamming more and more photos every day !! of course one day my patience was over and i had to end it. i deleted all the pictures.<br>

this page was made to post my personal stuff + things that inspire me. it was before i started making this website, it was my last chance to use a social media as a personal space and of course it wasn't a good idea because it's facebook, even if a fb page, it's still fb, and i don't like it at all, i just like to post aesthetics there. i wasn't able to post my stuff properly, only images ! so, i gived up in a few months, and stopped posting everything personal, even images. i started making this website, and continued posting art that inspire me on this page, because it's still nice to post and people can get inspired too ! i really like to spread the art of talented people.<br>

this story is quite complicated and people are always doing theories and <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/PsOlNuM.png" target="_blank">posting</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/I4WhevB.png" target="_blank">screenshots</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/rm1AqD9.png" target="_blank">about</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/O5ETyMe.png" target="_blank">it</a>.. i think it's time to say what really happened to my ig : i used my acc for a short six months ( approximately ), problems began to happen at three months, i couldn't stop following people or following more people, my acc was frozen for about a month like this. i ignored it, but then i could no longer comment, they just vanished. then things started to get really heavy : my pics were erased randomly. sometimes it took a few days, a few hours, sometimes it was instantaneous, it would always disappear. i was already with many followers to that point, i was losing many because my account was becoming a mess. i was upset and contacted the instagram countless times, until one day they said that my account had been hacked. they did nothing about it really so i changed the password several times, but the problem persisted, random comments and pics were erased all the time. i always put the link of my ig on fb pages, so i had many followers, but when i started to suspect the activities i told everyone to stop following me because i would make another account, so i lost a massive number of followers ( i don't know if this was really the cause of the loss of followers because it was really a lot ). i deleted most of the pics, i left only 15 there and i didn't use the acc anymore. i decided not to make another account at all because of the problems and how nobody did anything to help me. the acc is still there until today.<br>
