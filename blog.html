hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ShvX4UB.gif"/><br>
yes, so many posts in a short time <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bMjk3ob.gif"/><br>
this is because i have a lot of content to post here, and more and more... so i have planned several posts yet for this year !<br>
i have learned a lot about plants, it has become a great interest <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iyUbUmA.gif"/><br>
i've always been very interested in animals, but i think plants are also great, i just.. really like to take care of other living things, in general.<br>
i feel really good helping who i can, i want to take care of many plants and animals, the best as i can <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MLt1jzy.gif"/><br>
<br>
i have organized many things here these days, old things.<br>
this has left me pretty nostalgic, so i decided to start some projects to "eternalize" my memories !<br>
i have several letter paper and notebook pages that i kind of collected when i was in school, so i decided to cover a box with my favorite papers and use it to keep my journals. i've had diaries since i was 8, so they're very precious to me ♡<br>
the box got a 2000s aesthetic with many different shades of pink and glitter.. which is nostalgically perfect, even if not very aesthetically neat, you know ?<br>
thinking about it, i remembered the digital stuff that i did at the time, that follow this same idea ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iEWWJy6.gif"/><br>
i have here folders with very old things, from when i started to use the internet, including several .txt files with posts that i posted on my old blog, all the images i used ( i always kept everything for security )<br>
and, i also have all the layouts i've done + the codes !!<br>
the only sad thing is that my old blog is not on the web.archive ( just a few specific things, but it's a mess )<br>
so i always looked at the posts in txt and the images... and it was not quite the same thing ; ;<br>
i would really like to eternalize my first layout, with everything in place !<br>
so i recreated my first layout ever, from 2006, with the codes and images and texts i had saved, with the post from when i started using this new layout, and it's all exactly as it was before ♡ !!!<br>
i used a cute weeaboo domain ( kawaii.info.gf ), because it really fits the whole thing ~<br>
i had to re-create some scripts that were for the old internet explorer, so it didn't work anymore.<br>
i used to embed youtube videos on the blog for music, so that's what i did. i didn't have the exact music i was using at the time, but i remember it was from di gi charat, so that's what i put there !<br>
i liked to use english words sometimes, but i didn't really know any english at the time. should be the reason why i put my personal info in the "things" column instead of the "me" one LOL<br>
if you know portuguese, you should be surprised with my correct grammar ( since i was 8 ), and it's true, i had the help of my mom to write everything right on my blog !<br>
of course my mom always knew what i posted on my blog, so she helped me a lot. it was a very important time for me, i was learning many new things and i read and write a lot ♡ !<br>
i think the internet can be very productive for children, if they use it in a healthy way.<br>
i have many good memories of my old blog, i'm very happy that now it really is properly eternalized, including in web.archive ( as well as all my precious things )<br>
i'll leave a backup here as well :<br>

i love her so much, i've made about 10 similar ones ♡ !!<br>
<br>
now i'm going to show you how i've decorated my old phone.<br>
i have a new phone now, but i'm going to keep using my old one, and that's why i want to take care of it.<br>
where i live is a bit dangerous to go out there with an expensive phone.. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6ullXa4.gif"/><br>
so my old phone is safer !<br>

i think everything turned out specially cute, it's vintage & elegant but also soft & cozy ♡<br>
i'll also show you how i decorated my new phone, in a next post !<br>
<br>
now, just as in previous posts, the q&a will be double !<br>
some of the next ones will be too, because i have really lots of subjects to write about..<br>
the first subject will be about web design & html, the second one will be about beauty care + an extra text about fashion !<br>
i really hope you like it ///<br>

　❀ ⅰ<br>
people who have an interest in web design often have doubts about how i made this site and all my html stuff. as you all know, i've made things in html for many years, and i make lots of original and random things all the time. html and css is really something i love ♡ !<br>
i made this site, just like all my stuff in html, from scratch. i write everything in notepad and test in .html files, or in <a text-decoration: none; href="https://milk.honey.my" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">my html tester</font></a>. i know there are several platforms nowadays that make things a lot easier, but i always did everything from scratch because it was how i decided to start with html, from the beginning i always thought : if i had total freedom with the codes and to put everything exactly where i want and as i wish ; it was perfect. it was what i wanted. dealing with platforms for web design has always irritated me a little, honestly ; ;<br>
so, i don't have platforms to recommend, besides tumblr, because i use it and never had problems. but still, dealing with pure html is my preferred way of doing things. if you are going to make a website that is a blog or something, which will always need to be updated, using a platform would be really simpler to begin with ; but i recommend training html the old way because it helps a lot in learning ! if you really want to do things beautifully and freely, you have to lose the fear of dealing with pure codes.<br>
web design obviously has a lot of aesthetic sense, but i've talked about aesthetics many times around here so i think this part is unnecessary... but still about visual, i really recommend you have folders of materials and graphics that can be useful. i have had several folders of materials since i was a kid, and i got all that content basically exploring the internet. blogs and websites of cute stuff are a bit rare nowadays, but on tumblr i always find it with a little effort !! the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://web.archive.org" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">web.archive</font></a> is also wonderful to find interesting sites. i have here on the site the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://middlepot.com/recommended" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">recommended page</font></a> where i have some sites & blog that can be useful for this, and i also have a <a text-decoration: none; href="https://potix-u.my.to" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">pixel blog</font></a>, where i have several things that i use ( the blogs that i reblog from are also good places ).<br>
now that you have several materials to do beautiful things, you need to deal with the code itself. i find html very easy, i learned to deal with it at 8, simply with small tutorials and mainly browsing other people's blogs. i know it may seem controversial but when it comes to html there is a lot that you can ( and should ) take reference to other people's codes because these are things that everyone can use and are not owned by someone specific. i honestly recommend that you always look at the source code of all the sites you are interested in understanding how they were made. after a little study you will understand how things work and will learn mostly from this practice. make sure you have a folder for codes ( you can just save it in txt files ) because you will always find things that are interesting and that you may want to use in the future ! when it comes to css and javascript ( style and script ) you can find some code that is original and can not be copied, but in this case you will certainly see a warning text. if you see no warning, you are free to try to use !<br>
to practice, i recommend doing small projects like some pictures and texts on the screen, cute little random things that you have in mind... just let the imagination flow, think of things you'd like to do with the codes you've saved. if you really want to do layouts for a website or blog, i recommend starting with a base code. it's very bad copying the whole source code from someone's site to use as a base, but many people provide very useful base codes for you to have room for all things, it makes things very easy ! you just have to decide what you want to do exactly and look for codes for that sort of thing. you can find whole codes that are visually neutral for you to modify, or you can find only parts of what you want. you can put it all together smoothly. if you are using specific platforms, you will need base code to do what you want functionally within the platform, since these have rules of use and operation.<br>
it's a lot of fun to add signatures and some codes that you specifically like in your base codes. seeing ideas being born is sure to be the biggest motivation for you, so please don't give up before you try !!!<br>
i have a base code myself, i always use some similar css and i have a pretty cute ascii art signature at the beginning and end of all html pages. in fact, to be clear, <b>i allow</b> you to always look at the source code of this site and my stuff if you need inspiration or understand how i did things in it. you can use all the scripts and css, too. just don't copy everything ( especially visually ), of course, be original !<br>
in the beginning, you may feel a little bit of tension in messing with the base code and ruining everything, but over time you will feel more comfortable. i took a lot of time to do things freely, remembering that i did my first layout at the age of 8, so although i managed to do pretty good things, i obviously had a long time to get to where i am today ///<br>
it's normal that you don't understand anything that's going on for a long time, but don't worry about it, because the important thing is that things are working. you will understand how everything works with practice. now, when it comes to javascript, the thing really complicates. is much more "programming" than html and css, so you'll have to study harder if you want to make interesting scripts by yourself ; but you don't have to worry about it if programming is not your interest because you can find the scripts you need to do all sorts of things if you search right. it is still possible to make great things only with your interest in the visual side of web design ♡ !<br>
good, now that you already have your inspirations, your materials & graphics folder, your useful codes folder, your base codes.. where to post your projects and studies ?<br>
there are several sites where you can post things in html, but i use and recommend github. in it you can make a repository for every project you have and put the .html files there, you can change the domain and everything. about domains, github has its own domain for pages, but there are other sites where you can get cute and exclusive domains for you ! the site i use to get all my html stuff domains is <a text-decoration: none; href="https://freedns.afraid.org" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">freedns</font></a> ( just be careful to choose only public domains ). by the way, you can also use those cute domains on tumblr.<br>
to get ssl on your html pages, remember that all the links you have in your code must be "https", including images and scripts. thus, you will be able to get ssl easily on any platform you are using ! finding good websites ( with ssl ) to host your stuff to use in your codes can be difficult and time-consuming, but i have on the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://middlepot.com/credits" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">credits page</font></a> all the sites i use to host each file type ! i recommend each of them, until the present moment.<br>
<br>
i think that's all !! everything that i indicated here are things that i legitimately do and that work for me.<br>
i hope from the bottom of my heart that i can help and inspire you ♡ !!!<br>
please feel free to ask me something else that i may have forgotten to explain here ( which is not too specific, because this text is more general as a guide for beginners )<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　❀ ⅱ<br>
before talking about beauty care, i would like to write a little more about my fashion style. i've already written about the styles that inspire me and that i'm interested in, but i didn't specified about my aesthetic inspirations for clothes and accessories !<br>
as you may already know by now, most of my things are handmade. i make practically all my accessories and my clothes are also customized by me or designed by me and made by my mom, who is a seamstress. practically everything i use is handmade, including handbags ( which are usually in the form of stuffed animals, because i think it's lovely ♡ ). i just don't work with shoes and hats, unfortunately ; ;<br>
for that reason i felt it would be great to have a store where i could sell things that i do, and i want to increase the variety of items more and more, as well as reach more people selling overseas !!<br>
but the point is : why do i make almost everything i use ?<br>
well, it started because i had a lot of interest in japanese brands and importing it was expensive and it was not a very viable option, so i started to have an interest in customization and crafting, something i had before but not with fashion. my mom has been a seamstress for a long time, but i didn't have much fashion sense for designing my clothes, choosing the right fabrics and everything. it was a matter of time before i was completely into these things ♡ !<br>
what most inspires my fashion style is obviously my main aesthetic, which involves comfort, nostalgia, femininity and delicacy ; these are the qualities that i always look for in my clothes and accessories.<br>
you know that i really value purity, and i believe wearing clothes that represent our personality and feelings is important for it. i feel extremely happy and comfortable to see that my appearance corresponds with who i am. i always look for fabrics that are soft and delicate, feminine accessories, delicate lace and ribbons, cute little animals on everything !! soft colors and a little "faded" tones are my favorite because they refer me to old stuffies, those that are super special, that you love so much and have great memories about.. i love cute & cozy motifs in general, but i also like motifs that match the weather because they usually help me feel refreshed when it's hot outside, and warm when it's cold.<br>
i believe the secret to finding the perfect style for you is just to find your favorite aesthetics and what best represents your personality ! the essential thing here is to respect your comfort and to have self knowledge. i would say that the more you have sharp eyes to find potential beauty in things, the simpler it becomes to have a style that perfectly represents you, so it's really a matter of practice. i super recommend to practice saving beautiful images that inspire you and making collages with them, it's a lot of fun ♡ !!<br>
the places that most inspire me for fashion are aesthetics blogs on tumblr, collage videos ( i have many in <a text-decoration: none; href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsBmCEP2InOp69wlTeQKg7GnB2EG5apxD" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">my asmr playlist</font></a>, which by the way is very visually consistent ), and i always use polyvore for the look ideas. if you like dress up games, i would say they are also very good inspirations : my first one was <i>poupée girl</i> ( which no longer exists, but i have lots of images on the gaming page ), but <i>cocoppa play</i> is also really good and is still active !<br>
of course you can vary your style within your aesthetics whenever you want, and it's something i've been trying a lot recently, but it just depends on how comfortable you feel at the moment with those clothes. according to the day, the weather and the situation, you can suddenly feel in a mood to try a very different style !!<br>
<br>
<br>
so, to begin with the beauty care texts, i would like to say that beauty is directly linked to good things about people. a kind person is certainly very beautiful, and i've talked about it before... but in a more visual way, i believe that the healthier and natural you look, the more beautiful, visually. if you keep artificial and unhealthy, it will be hard to feel comfortable in your body, and that is an important attribute for beauty. people who are just running away from their natural beauty have hard times with self-esteem, and that's sad.<br>
i would like to help, so i'll give you beauty tips on what i value : health and comfort !<br>
<br>
　　♡　skin care :<br>
i have very sensitive skin, i have allergies frequently. this condition always makes me worry about the products i use. i always use natural products or baby products, these don't give me allergy and luckily are also great, i don't think i should be using any other type of product !<br>
i think it is essential to keep the skin clean, hydrated and free of harsh chemicals. i always wash the skin with natural ( or baby ) soaps, which are very soft and don't take too much natural oil from the skin. my skin is not very oily so i worry about keeping the natural oils and using them to my advantage. i've never had problems with acne or blackheads, but i've always had whiteheads, what have helped me more than anything about them and also keeps my skin completely clean of any pollution are two things : honey and rose milk !<br>
honey is truly amazing, the skin becomes incredibly soft, clean, with an incredible natural glow and it also helps a lot in recovering from any damage, since it has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. i use honey on my skin frequently, i also use it + sugar to exfoliate from time to time. i always use in bruises and when my skin is having allergic reactions to avoid bigger problems and help in healthy recovery.<br>
rose milk is basically rose water + baking soda and some other things, which make the rose water become milky in texture and color. this mixture cleans a lot from any pollution, it's amazing and i use it whenever i feel i need.<br>
to moisturize i always use natural oils or baby oil. i always apply by massaging on the whole body, especially in areas with more fat, because this helps blood circulation and the skin gets more elasticity ( massaging the face is also very important ). my favorite oils are coconut oil and almond oil ! i think the combination of the two smells like honey, but everyone says it smells like vanilla. i love vanilla and honey, so i'm happy anyway ♡<br>
despite my skin care routine ( with cleansing, exfoliation & hydration ) is only once a day, it's important to keep the skin clean and moisturized all day. during the winter my skin gets very dry, so i'm always moisturizing it, multiple times a day. during the summer my skin easily looks greasy, especially if i'm outside, so i always clean my face and hands with baby wipes ( washing only with fresh water is most appropriate but not always possible ) and use moisturizer. keeping the skin fresh is very important to avoid pollution and premature aging !<br>
i can also recommend you to always wash your face with cold water ( your pores NEVER should be left open ), wear sunscreen every day, i recommend the most natural ones with coconut oil ( the sun is important and it is good to sunbathe in the morning, but the afternoon sun can be terribly bad for your skin + NEVER pose your face towards the sun ) and of course : drink lots of water ( two liters a day is the minimum ), this is really important !!<br>
<br>
　　♡　hair care :<br>
because of the sensitivity of my skin, i also use natural products or baby products in my hair, of course. since my hair is completely natural i don't need to worry so much about it, i use few products. my hair is very wavy and long. it is also not too oily just like my skin, so i also like to take advantage of the natural oils. i usually wash it three times a week in hot weather and twice in cold weather, i only use water and baby shampoo normally. no conditioner. why did i mention the water ? because it is very important, even if you have not thought about it, it's part of the cleaning process as well. i always wash my hair with plenty of water and rub well the root to spread the natural oils to the tips, only after i use a little shampoo to clean the excess oil, sweat and pollution. i feel that this process makes my hair much lighter and it gets very clean, soft and hydrated ! for extra hydration i always use natural oils, the same ones i use for the skin. washing with cold water is very important to prevent oiliness in the hair, i also always use cold dryer. always dry the root very well !<br>
another thing that i think is very important is combing your hair with a wide wooden comb ( or a similar brush ). these combs keeps the hair very soft and hydrated up to the tips, plus they don't cause hair loss or frizz. to keep your hair always looking soft and moisturized from the root to the tips it's very important to brush your hair multiple times a day, especially if you are out there because the pollution gives it a greasy look that is not healthy.<br>
<br>
　　♡　makeup :<br>
um i almost don't wear makeup, so i surely don't have much experience to talk about it. i don't like to wear makeup because i feel my skin very weird.. i only use it on special occasions, even though it is always very light. i think wearing just a little makeup helps my skin stay healthy, anyway. it doesn't like many products.<br>
i don't like wearing base or concealer, i just have bb cream in case there is something wrong that i want to cover.. usually there is nothing, i don't have so dark circles, i'm used to it, so i just let it be.<br>
in my eyes my biggest problem is my eyelashes, you must have realized that they are very straight. i don't like that, so it's common for me to use eyelash curler and transparent mascara, just to keep them in place. i have brown eye pencils and eyeshadow for sometimes delineating, i like to keep it as natural as possible.<br>
i don't do anything with my eyebrows, i don't really bother with them all natural.<br>
i don't like bronzer, but i really like blush, i like it a lot. i also like highlighter, but i use it wisely ( i try ). i always get inspired in igari makeup and i struggle not to use too much blush and look like sunburned ; ;<br>
on my lips i always moisturize constantly with natural oils ( my lips get dry often i hate it ), but i am truly an eternal lover of lip gloss and lip balm. i don't like lipsticks, though. i like to have my lips super moisturized and shiny, but not colored.<br>
umm and sometimes i add a little tiny bit of white glitter on my cheeks, lips or eyelids ! i think it's very cute.<br>
<br>
　　♡　nails :<br>
i'm also not experienced with nail art, but i'll talk about my nails anyway. i think there are not many secrets to getting your nails healthy, i think proper nutrition and hydration are the most important thing. my nails grow very fast, just like my hair, i can't really tell the reasons because it was always like this.. but i can say i always keep them super moisturized with natural oils ( the same ones i use for the skin ), i moisturize them multiple times a day, whenever i wash my hands. it's very important to always keep your nails clean and moisturized, so i never forget the baby wipes and the moisturizer when i'm outside !<br>
i always cut the cuticles ( not too much, just the excess ) and keep them clean. i used to paint my nails often and did nail art on them, but i stopped doing it because i just don't feel interested anymore. people always say that keeping nails painted is important to keep them strong but i can confirm that this is a myth, at least partially. when i always painted my nails and one day i didn't they were really weak, it's true ; but this is because they were already damaged by the use of nail polish. when i stopped using nail polish frequently, after a few months they became stronger, beautiful and healthier than ever before ! in this case, it depends on whether you want to use polish frequently or not.<br>
i usually keep my nails very short and oval shape, but when i'm in the mood i let them a little longer and almond shape.<br>
<br>
　　♡ tl ; dr :<br>
if you always stay clean, moisturized and hydrated you will always be healthy and flawless from the beginning until the end of the day, which will definitely make your life a lot better !!<br>
<br><br>
i'm very sincere in these texts, really based on personal experiences.<br>
i always try my best to be clear and useful to you, so please tell me your opinions ///<br>

it was a great experience for me to deal with so different color tones together !<br>
i feel like i usually run away from dark colors on almost anything, but they also represent a part of who i am, it's important that i practice more how to use them within my aesthetic !<br>

with kinda the same aesthetic, i made a page in html that is very simple, but it is somehow very important for me.<br>
of course, with matching url ( soft.root.sx )<br>
i've always wanted to do something like this in html, but it's strangely time-consuming, even though it looks so simple <img src="https://i.imgur.com/P7CUMWo.gif"/><br>

i'm just extremely inspired, i really hope it's not tiring for you ///<br>
the first one is about cuteness & femininity, the second one is about group behavior !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　✄ ⅰ<br>
people have always had a problem with female stereotypes. there is pressure on the girls to be always cute, feminine and delicate. i totally disapprove of people trying to shape the personality of people for the purpose of making them "ideal" within stereotypes ; although girls and boys have hormones that bring tendencies in tastes, desires and looks, a person's sex has no relation to her personality, since that is something much deeper. i agree that girls and boys should not change their personality with the intention of feeling "fit" in society, since this behavior causes sadness, confusion, problems and unhealthy relationships.<br>
but, in the search of freedom of aesthetics and mannerisms people began to always treat these feminine adjectives as if they were something inferior and undesirable. i have read countless times about how "being cute and delicate is desirable in society because they want women to be weak and controllable", and no, that's not a correct way to talk about it !!!<br>
the cuteness, delicacy and elegance are feminine characteristics, and just like the masculine characteristics, are tendencies but not facts. a girl may have more masculine characteristics, and vice versa ; there is nothing wrong with that. in nature the feminine and the masculine work together and form all that exists of good ( and bad ), it's the balance of things. the personality of people is complex and there are no sex tendencies that change a person completely, so of course you should not change who you are because of that ; but wanting to reject your natural feminine qualities because you somehow think that male qualities are better, is a very serious problem. it is actually offensive to the female image.<br>
makes me deeply sad as people speak as if being soft and delicate is a sign of weakness and inferiority when there is no connexion between these things. to say that being feminine is a bad thing and that we must fight not to appear feminine and delicate for not to be treated in a bad way is so extremely wrong !!<br>
girls and boys in nature have strength, endurance and power equally, only represented in different ways. matriarchal and patriarchal societies are focused on these forces : motherhood & paternity. these are the most natural and pure in both, both take care of each other as family, both have different but equally important roles. the problem is that patriarchal society often makes it seem that the male strenght is desirable and important, that physical strength, dominance, and logical reasoning are the best, that emotional intelligence, kindness, and wisdom are weak. this is not true, because there is not one better than the other ( and i've written about this before ).<br>
in fact, the female image is also very associated with beauty. this obviously doesn't mean that girls should be beautiful, but i would like to comment that this type of beauty is associated with health and youth, since it is something that is naturally bright and wonderful related to fertility. in this way, while healthy, pure and natural, feminine beauty is something that i appreciate a lot and that i also think should not be treated as objectification ; the real objectification is the plastic and artificial way the girls force themselves to be to have social approval.<br>
so yes, if your personality have cuteness and femininity, it doesn't mean that you are inferior or childish. you should not be ashamed of it or try to become more masculine ( even if you are indeed a boy ). you must above all embrace your natural qualities and your personality traits as your strength and importance in society exist anyway and are great. you can have an even submissive personality, and that doesn't mean you don't have the right to be happy like that and have control over your life and your actions !<br>
just remember that you deserve to be happy and respected, you are strong and lovely no matter how feminine or masculine you are, you can - and should - be purely yourself ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
　✄ ⅱ<br>
this recent subject about "npc" people is something that has been around for a long time, but with other names. i really think being a npc is a bad thing, but i'm seeing people using it as a baseless curse, i see people with clear group behavior using the term to get approved and feel superior to others. i believe that this whole thing can be very productive if seen and treated the right way, so i felt the need to write about it !<br>
group behavior is basically what the idea of ​​being an npc is all about. it's about acting only in favor of the group, seeking approval from the group and always feel the need to be part of groups and overestimate this attitude as if it were something important. this is a purely instinctive and standard attitude of our species, so i believe it is natural and healthy to have group behavior during a phase of life, usually in adolescence, while we are still trying to perceive our individuality ( which has always been there, we have only forgotten who we are because puberty causes our hormones to take actions above who we really are, basically for the sake of the reproduction of the species ).<br>
the problem of such attitudes is that they separate us from purity and consequently from happiness. as we are rational animals, group behavior, although natural and to make our brain release endorphins ( as instinctive approval ), makes us take actions that do not make us really happy. the pursuit of standards, mimic behavior, obeying rules that we don't really value, following trends that don't match our personality... all of this is extremely tiring and painful for us. the npc behavior is in fact something bad and that must be overcome, because although institive, is not ideal. you are not doing your best if you are acting as a group because you are an individual.<br>
i see many people with npc behavior using this as offense because they relate specific things to "being an npc", such as using social media, having groups of friends, using slangs... but the thing is that group behavior is not something that it is necessarily shown through these attitudes, for a person can of their own volition want to have some of these attitudes, because it makes they happy. making the decision to have some natural, instinctive behavior as something that you truly value is an important and rational decision that is right for our ability. for example, i want to form a family, it's a group behavior and extremely instinctive : to live with my partner, to procreate, to take care of my group. but if i had made that decision only because it's the standard of our society, it could be sad for me and against my will as an individual ! i want to have a family because only the thought of it warms my heart and i know it is my pure wish.<br>
the desire for stamina for group behavior can be replaced by other more useful and healthy attitudes such as helping others, striving for a cause that you truly value, giving gifts, giving compliments... the list goes on !<br>
we don't have to obey our instincts, but they can guide us to important things if we are strong enough to make our own choices. ♡<br>
<br>
i hope this helps some people !!<br>

my lovely store is open and with an extremely cute layout !!!!<br>
modesty aside, i'm really in love with the layout i made ♡ !<br>
i'm so very happy to have decided to make a layout of my own. before i was not going to do it and i was going to use a platform, i thought it would make things easier ...<br>
but i definitely think it's important that my store is as cute as possible and i'd like to do my best for that !!!<br>
i used a subdomain for the store : https://shybunny.middlepot.com<br>
it's all in portuguese because at least for now i'm giving priority to sales here in brazil, but i'm accepting some of these too ( i wrote more about it on the site )<br>
<br>
so, i made yesterday a very cute new flash game <img src="https://i.imgur.com/doqIwv1.gif"/><br>
... not about halloween but i also posted one last year, remember ?<br>

i once wrote about myself and my personality and i mentioned how i like to organize and improve myself, and how i like rules. as i always support the purity, happiness & comfort of people, why would i support rules being imposed to shape us ?<br>
i know it can be confusing, but i actually think the rules, if handled correctly, can help us a lot to find out more about ourselves, and not shape ourselves to be something different, but the other way around.<br>
social and behavioral rules can be very oppressive and force us to act in an uncomfortable way, to make us confused under the obligation to be accepted socially above being ourselves, and happy ; but by analyzing these kinds of rules and constantly questioning them, i could see that they actually made me realize who i really am ! by reading these rules and wondering if they really fit into my lifestyle and personality, i could see clearly what i wanted or not for my life. i could understand the principles and foundations of these rules, and where they "wanted us to go". usually social and behavioral rules have the general objective that you be a nice person and don't bother other people, and that is a good thing ; the problem is that these have very specific peculiarities that don't fit for anyone. all people feel uncomfortable and unhappy if they try to follow all these rules strictly because they don't fit everyone. in short, my solution to achieving a healthy life was to adapt these rules to my way !<br>
i really like writing rules for myself and even having rules made for me, reading about all those rules and "good manners" that are supposed to make a "good person". i find it very productive and it helps me a lot to find myself individually rewriting these rules so that they still have their main good intention but in a way that is comfortable for me as a person. i can see how personally i could feel happy to follow some good, healthy rules as a way of reminders. i value a lot of rules that involve kindness, education and respect, as i believe that it is fundamental to have healthy relationships and it makes me happy ; it just happens that these rules are very "heavy" and try to change ourselves, but there are usually ways of interpreting and rewriting them that make them good and productive for our lives.<br>
it is clear that some rules simply don't fit my life at all, and should be discarded. unfortunately, even striving to keep polite and sincere with people who question me about such "weird" attitudes that i choose for my life ( for example refusing to be in social events supposed to be important to my social life, but that doesn't make me happy ) people will still judge me negatively because i didn't obey "the rule". this is something we naturally suffer as a consequence of being truly honest and kind to ourselves, but it is also an important process in the pursuit of purity.<br>
i really care about evaluating my behavior, in general. when we are busy with our tasks we may forget to take care of ourselves, so i believe it is very important to always stop from time to time and think "how am i feeling ?", "is my body feeling well ?". stop for drinking water, wash your face, eat a fruit, walking, adjusting the lighting... these simple things are primordial to maintain our physical and mental health. like this habit, when i'm interacting with other people i always evaluate my behavior to see if i'm expressing myself properly, if i'm being kind, sincere, if i'm being myself, if the conversation is being comfortable for me and the other person. this may seem maybe a little "obsessive", but if done in a healthy and natural way is very good and greatly improves our quality of life. all these "rules" are about doing my best and not letting myself get carried away by the things of life and forgetting about my health or being nice to people.<br>
it's primordial not to expect other people's approval and social validation when defining your rules and lifestyle, but rather how you personally, from the heart, feel about it. of course, you will feel happy and satisfied in being a good person and not messing around, but it is completely different from pretending just to receive compliments, to feel included and correct. the most correct and valid you can be is yourself ♡<br>
<br>
i know it's a little difficult to understand, but i hope i have explained it clearly !!<br>
happy halloween for you, be careful not to eat toooooo much candy <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cwyTIFV.gif"/><br>
