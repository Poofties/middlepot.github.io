where do you live, is it getting hot or cold ?<br>
here is a super nice climate, a gentle cold, soft sunlight + the rains have stopped completely. it's my favorite weather season !!<br>
for those who remember the past post, my trip with bubu was magical, i would like to travel with him all the time ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
it's not usual for me to travel, i sometimes spend years without leaving nearby. i want to travel a lot in the future <img src="https://i.imgur.com/V6FLtp7.gif"/><br>
<br>
i made two new playlists recently and would like to comment on them because i think they are interesting !<br>
i made a playlist with only brazilian music, since i was born and live here ( in são paulo ). i decided to do it because i know that the brazilian culture is extremely diverse and yet stereotyped. it's a country with a diversity of immigrants, so people don't usually know much about many super nice things that are from here. if you think of brazilian music you will definitely think of samba, but i do not particularly like it, as well as many people here.<br>
in this playlist i put together some popular music that everyone knows here and that were part of my childhood, only music i like and listen until nowadays !<br>
most of them are from the 80s and 90s, but these are the ones i really like. i think currently music here is not good at all ...<br>
but i would like to talk more about brazil, things that i love here and things that i consider terrible, the changes as the decades went by and my plans for the future,,, in another post ( spoiler : i do not intend to live here forever ).<br>
well, i hope you like the songs because they are great and very special for me ! i'll add more as you like.<br>
<br>
the other playlist that i would like to talk about is the asmr one. it's a playlist i've been thinking about for some time, since i usually watch a lot of asmr channels that are not very well known and many videos that i like are asmr not intentional. you will find all kind of stimmy and aesthetically pleasing videos !<br>
most videos are from japanese and korean channels, but some videos are in english and portuguese.<br>
i hope this playlist will help you relax and discover new content !!<br>
maybe you can even learn to make some recipes <sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jdce4lV.gif"/></sub></sub><br>

these drawings are so lovely !! her name is julie ♡<br>
i really enjoyed painting the little flowers on the dress, it was very relaxing.<br>
<br>
today i decided to answer to you several doubts and curiosities related to the changes that have happened in my social media over the last years.<br>

i created the page with a friend and the tumblr blog later, in order to improve the content of the page, improving its aesthetics. the problem is that our opinions were very different and she posted things very different from me, so everything was a mess. so far so good, but the biggest problem was that she liked to post things from kink blogs and lots of offensive stuff that i think it's very bad and ruined the page environment completely. our friendship dissolved over time ( not only because of that ) and she decided she didn't want to post on the page or tumblr anymore for lack of time, so i erased all the content that i definitely hate and left everything clean and neat again. posting alone i could have control over the content quality and aesthetics. i hope that everything has been completely deleted, i'm very ashamed of this past. if you find anything, PLEASE let me know !<br>
<br>
　　　𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚏𝚊𝚗 𝚙𝚒𝚌 𝚍𝚊𝚢 _<br>
who knows the not bad page since its beginning remembers that saturday was a day where i posted pictures from followers. the intention was to post beautiful pics that matched the aesthetics of the page, but things didn't go very well.. saturday became a very annoying day, people only sent super edited selfies and poor quality pics, even super inappropriate ones. and if i didn't post those pics, people would get really mad at me and keep spamming more and more photos every day !! of course one day my patience was over and i had to end it. i deleted all the pictures.<br>
<br>
　　　𝚖𝚒𝚍𝚍𝚕𝚎𝚙𝚘𝚝 𝚙𝚊𝚐𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚎𝚗𝚝 _<br>
this page was made to post my personal stuff + things that inspire me. it was before i started making this website, it was my last chance to use a social media as a personal space and of course it wasn't a good idea because it's facebook, even if a fb page, it's still fb, and i don't like it at all, i just like to post aesthetics there. i wasn't able to post my stuff properly, only images ! so, i gived up in a few months, and stopped posting everything personal, even images. i started making this website, and continued posting art that inspire me on this page, because it's still nice to post and people can get inspired too ! i really like to spread the art of talented people.<br>

this story is quite complicated and people are always doing theories and <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/PsOlNuM.png" target="_blank">posting</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/I4WhevB.png" target="_blank">screenshots</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/rm1AqD9.png" target="_blank">about</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/O5ETyMe.png" target="_blank">it</a>.. i think it's time to say what really happened to my ig : i used my acc for a short six months ( approximately ), problems began to happen at three months, i couldn't stop following people or following more people, my acc was frozen for about a month like this. i ignored it, but then i could no longer comment, they just vanished. then things started to get really heavy : my pics were erased randomly. sometimes it took a few days, a few hours, sometimes it was instantaneous, it would always disappear. i was already with many followers to that point, i was losing many because my account was becoming a mess. i was upset and contacted the instagram countless times, until one day they said that my account had been hacked. they did nothing about it really so i changed the password several times, but the problem persisted, random comments and pics were erased all the time. i always put the link of my ig on fb pages, so i had many followers, but when i started to suspect the activities i told everyone to stop following me because i would make another account, so i lost a massive number of followers ( i don't know if this was really the cause of the loss of followers because it was really a lot ). i deleted most of the pics, i left only 15 there and i didn't use the acc anymore. i decided not to make another account at all because of the problems and how nobody did anything to help me. the acc is still there until today.<br>
<br>
<br>
are we clear now ? i hope so !<br>

hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QwgXhbN.gif"/><br>
i would like to thank once again the support you give me, it is really very special for me !!<br>
the ideas you give me are very useful and i never tire of saying thank you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3ubYtGu.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4xWUuUR.gif"/><br>
because of my routine post yesterday i received some messages thanking the inspiration for organization and productivity, but i also received some rather sad messages saying that they couldn't be productive or follow schedules like me.<br>
i would like to clarify that although schedules are important, it is not always possible to follow them.<br>
sometimes i go to sleep later than i intended, sometimes i wake up with a headache, i don't force myself to go beyond my limits <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrqO7A4.gif"/><br>
everyone has different limits, you don't have to do multiple tasks every day, you don't have to wake up at 6:30 am, it's different for every person !<br>
your routine should be tailored to your lifestyle and your chores and hobbies should be things that you feel good doing, and i didn't include household chores in the routine because they vary according to need, but i have these as well, every day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTuY6k2.gif"/><br>
it's important to be productive but it's also important to stay healthy and happy, never forget <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qjiy032.gif"/><br>
<br>
soooooo, i'm super happy these days because tomorrow, day 5, me and bubu have completed 5 years of dating ♡ !!!!<br>
we're going to take a little trip together and i'm super extremely excited and i dream about it every day !!<br>
i love him so so so so so much <img src="https://i.imgur.com/g5pvtoc.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ANrPV0v.gif"/><br>
<br>
today i'm going to finally show you something that you asked me since the videos on my phone, i'll show you a little bit of my notebook :<br>

next time i want to record something in portuguese, i think it would be interesting.<br>
what do you think ?<br>
<br>
so /// because of yesterday's very personal post with information about my personality, some people asked me to post some things about my body as well. i thought a lot about it because it's very intimate and i don't like to post so many things like that ...<br>
but i decided that i'll post, since these are information that anyone who knows me personally would know, there is nothing so secret about it.<br>
i'll add these in the faq :<br>
<br>
✂　my height is 5,5. average, i guess ?<br>
✂　i weight 117 lbs. i think i'm skinny, but not super skinny, i'm okay.<br>
✂　i don't want to share measurements here, but i really like my body shape ! according to my measures, i'm hourglass figure.<br>
✂　my skin is pale, but not super pale. i hate tanning because my skin is really sensitive and turns red only ; ;<br>
✂　my hair changes color very much according to the lighting, but it also becomes clearer if i go out in the sun. it's dark blond / light brown and sometimes it gets a little bit orange, but it's only noticeable in the sunlight.<br>
✂　i like to keep a "himecut" in my hair, with short side bangs ( it's cute but also a bit more mature than straight bangs ). i cut my hair myself. i'm lazy so it's common for my bangs to be super long + my hair is quite wavy, so the cut is not so noticeable.<br>
✂　my eyes are between blue and green ( cyan, turquoise ) + a little bit grayish.<br>
✂　i don't know my shoe size to be honest, but my feet are 24cm.<br>
✂　um... i'm a-cup ;////;<br>
<br>
... of course i would not leave the post with just that, it would be shameful.<br>
i have something much more important to post on today's q&a, super very extremely important :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i would like to talk about these two adjectives that are so confusing to people : pure & innocent.<br>
these are actually extremely important things, but are treated as something far, almost impossible to achieve. and that's not true, because it's something we can all go back to.<br>
to explain it better, let's define purity and innocence :<br>
purity, as i have already commented in other posts, is something that you are when you're being yourself. when you act naturally and follow your heart, when you do not listen to what others think is good for you, but what your heart says is best for you. your heart wants you to have a clear conscience, want you to stay safe and healthy, wants you to be happy. it's not always the easiest path, but it's always the right one, the pure one. purity is literally not be contaminated by external influences. it's hard because we live in society and we need to please others, but it doesn't mean that you need to change who you are ( not even a little bit ) to be a nice person, and be happy.<br>
innocence is something that people often confuse with ignorance. when you don't know things by choice, you are being ignorant, which is a bad quality. innocence is when you see the world in a beautiful way, when you believe in your dreams, believe things can get better, do not judge others before you know, when even after being bitten by a dog, do not you think all dogs are evil. so, innocence is more linked to positivity, it's a quality of being radiant and full of love, even having gone through difficult things, or not. of course it's easier to be positive when you don't have traumas to deal with, but that's not the point. it is possible, and it is necessary for you to be happy !<br>
children are pure and innocent because they have not been "contaminated" by society's pressure to be different from who they really are, to give up their dreams, to think the world and people are bad and it's always getting worse. this is not right and it's not true. it's a super toxic thought.<br>
other ( nonhuman ) animals are like children forever, for at least none of them still live in society like humans. society itself is not a problem, but people just don't have the maturity to deal with it in a healthy way. it's something that people should educate themselves and educate their children so that we can all be happier !!<br>
never think that you have no hope, that you are dirty or rotten, that your dreams can't come true, that magic doesn't exist. erase it forever from your life !!! learning to evaluating your behavior and the way you see the world is very important to becoming a better and more satisfied person. believe in your dreams, make the little you from the past proud of who you became today ♡ !<br>
<br>
i really hope it touched your heart !<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FImDn9i.gif"/><br>
aaaa //// i'm so thankful for the cute messages i've received lately !!<br>
you all are so kind to me, i don't deserve it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OT3hgIG.gif"/><br>
also, i love it when you send me suggestions. i like to post things you want to see !<br>
<br>
um, so, do you remember that i was training to be ambidextrous ?<br>
i think i can consider that i already got there !!<br>
i really can't believe how fast that was, i thought it would take a long time <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2fh66l4.gif"/><br>
i am training every day using my left hand to do day-to-day tasks, and to write.<br>
i'd say i can do things 80% the same way with my left hand now !<br>
and i can write with the same handwriting, but it's a bit slower ( i never can write too fast anyway )<br>
well, i am very proud of the progress ♡ !!<br>
<br>
today the post will be a little more personal, since you have been asking for some little things ///<br>
these days i was writing down my routine, as usual. i usually write down daily task lists, but i always had some items that i repeated every day.<br>
for ease, i wrote down these items in a txt, which i kept for a while. it was not very cute, so i thought i should write it somewhere else ...<br>
i was in the mood to do some pretty cute html page, so i did one with some things from my routine !!<br>
it was quite spontaneous, i was not even going to show it to anyone at first.<br>
but as you asked for some more personal things like that, and it was so cute, i decided to post !<br>
and with a super cute url ( comfy.softcoffee.ro ), of course <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2DYo6uh.gif"/><br>
i will leave here a backup file, as always :<br>

well.. like i said, i can record reading stories, fairytales .. i like this kind of content and it's a little hard to find, so i'll try hard to do it, if you want, of course ; ;<br>
( please do not ask me to record more singing cause this is too much for me LOL )<br>
<br>
because of the other post where i say that i don't like people to "guess" my personality through tests, astrology, blood type or anything, you asked me to post things about my personality.<br>
i'm actually quite honored that you really care about me that way, it's very sweet <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WatUq79.gif"/><br>
i thought about it for a while, i don't really like to talk about myself so deeply, but since this is a more personal post... here it is :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
　　　　　𝓅𝓮𝓇𝓈𝓸𝓃𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓉𝓎 𝓉𝓇𝒶𝒾𝓉𝓈 :<br>
<br>
❀　i'm very shy & introverted. so, because of my introversion, i don't feel bad for being shy, it's just part of me ;<br>
❀　i'm full of love and i do my best to take care of others and myself. i want to bring comfort and safety to everyone !<br>
❀　i have difficulties in approaching and sometimes i never feel comfortable near some people ;<br>
❀　when i'm comfortable with people, i talk a lot about random things, sometimes i even talk too much ///<br>
❀　i usually adapt to different situations and different people "changing moods", sometimes i get into it a lot and i feel confused, but i'm always myself ;<br>
❀　i'm always evaluating my behavior to improve myself, but sometimes i take it too seriously and get overwhelmed ;<br>
❀　i love rules ! i love to make rules for myself, to have rules made for me and to follow them. rules often make me happy because they make me a better person ;<br>
❀　i make lists all the time to be able to have an organized routine and take time to practice all my hobbies. feeling busy with things that i like makes me feel pretty satisfied !<br>
❀　i think too much about everything and sometimes i feel melancholic ;<br>
❀　i deeply value the purity. for me purity is directly linked to your true personality, who you really are. i never forget who i am and what i believed and wanted from myself when i was a child and i want more than anything to be proud of myself, the child i will always be.<br>
<br>
　　　　　𝓮𝓍𝓉𝓇𝒶 :<br>
<br>
❀　my sense of humor is quite childish, so i laugh at really silly things ;<br>
❀　i cry a lot, sad and happy ;<br>
❀　my main interest is beautiful things and to make things beautiful ;<br>
❀　i like everything that warms my heart and i try to fill my life with these things ;<br>
❀　people say i smell like vanilla. i think i smell like honey ///<br>
❀　i love animals, especially babies, i love taking care of babies ♡ !!!<br>
❀　i love nature, she is everything to me, i struggle daily to feel part of her and understand my instincts and role in life. this has made me extremely happy and helps me overcome any personal problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
.. that's it ///<br>
