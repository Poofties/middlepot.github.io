hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rg8poHP.gif"/><br>
i realize how this website has grown since its creation and i am very proud of the progress <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3SNUoL5.gif"/><br>
i'm doing my best to bring frequent updates and useful content to you !!<br>
please ask me complex questions to write about, it's hard to think about subjects that seem relevant..<br>
i get many questions that would not really do a good q&a, you know ?<br>
<br>
you know that i have a routine page, i have schedules to do certain things and daily tasks, this helps me a lot to organize things, as well as my weekly listings and schedules.<br>
of course life doesn't always collaborate and we have to make adaptations, but it is great to have a base to know what to do and not waste time.<br>
so, i've been trying hard to spend less time on the internet lately !<br>
if i'm forced to do this i always find a way to do everything in a short time, but it is difficult to have discipline when i have free time ; ;<br>
some of my tasks require the internet, so i defined a period of 3 hours a day as the maaaaximum time on the internet, on those more complicated days ; but i usually spend 2 hours or even 1 hour and i'm very happy about it ♡ !<br>
it's a very important practice, especially for those who do many "quiet" activities like me, it is necessary to space these times to stretch, drink water, make snacks and take some air outside.<br>
in fact, i would like to clarify that i don't really wake up 6 am going to sleep 1 am, it would be torture.. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NtMNFpN.gif"/><br>
i just get up to watch the sunrise ( when it's possible, i really like doing it ), so i also eat a fruit and plan my day ; if it's very hot i like to take a shower to refresh, then i go back to sleep until 10 am !<br>
i just really wake up at 6 am if i need to and in that case i always go to bed before midnight.<br>
<br>
i was writing lots of letters lately and thinking.. sometimes i get a little annoyed with my handwriting because it's very... childish <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Clflx9p.gif"/><br>
i don't know how to explain, i don't think it's ugly, it's kinda cute ; but it's a little clumsy, small and "roundy", it's the same handwriting that i see in my old school notebooks !!<br>
if you have already exchanged letters with me or have already seen my handwriting fonts you will understand.<br>
( by the way, if you are interested in exchanging letters don't hesitate to contact me in the email because i love doing this ♡ )<br>
i really like calligraphy so i train a lot, i like to write in different letters to make decorated titles and "aesthetic" texts, but my natural handwriting really is childish and there's nothing i can do about it ; ;<br>
they say people's handwriting reflects their personality, i know everyone has a unique handwriting that is a "brand" of them and that's very special ♡<br>
but it is impossible not to envy people who have naturally mature and elegant handwriting ///<br>
well, i can "simulate" this if i really want to, but it's not the same since it inevitably doesn't suit me very much so i usually just prefer to be myself.<br>
<br>
enough of talking, today the post will have a super cute drawing that i painted ♡ !<br>

<br><br>
have you ever seen people who are so beautiful, kind and have a lovely aura that makes everyone feel comfortable and safe around ? it seems like a rare and precious personality trait, like this person knows nothing bad and lives in a beautiful and different reality.<br>
in fact, i have learned over time that this is a skill to be acquired with maturity. bad experiences don't influence who you really are and shouldn't make you have a heavy and sad aura. bad experiences happen for you to mature and to be able to avoid them in the future, as well as helping other people in a similar situation ; traumas are not part of you, all bad things you've been through, you've seen or just know that exist, none of that is part of you and none of that represents your reality.<br>
you should never become ignorant, keep yourself informed of the world situation and mold your opinions is very important to live healthy and safe ! however, it is extremely important to keep yourself pure despite all this. purity will give you a different aura and will make your reality, in fact, beautiful.<br>
don't let bad thoughts and memories affect you continuously ; boring and ugly things are a part of life and you really should deal with them properly and don't ignore them, but you should not make them a personal problem. on daily basis you should forget everything bad and only think of beautiful and pleasant things that you live, lived and would like to live : daydream, watch the sky, pick flowers, write love letters, wear perfume, put on pajamas all day, wear your favorite dress casually ! life has many opportunities for you to make it beautiful and create good memories for you to keep and share with others.<br>
surround yourself with beautiful things, embellish ugly things you don't like to look at, cherish people who love you & move away from people who are toxic to you. small details in your life can greatly help shaping your ability to be positive and emanate kindness and beauty ♡<br>
<br>
remember : the kinder you are, the more beautiful you become ( and that includes being kind to yourself )<br>

this is a very special month, since it's the 1 year anniversary of middlepot.com + i turn 21 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/adJshVZ.gif"/><br>
i wish i could express in words how much i love this place and how i love to post here ♡ !!<br>
it was definitely the best thing i've done to date and i plan to make it better and better for me and you fluffies, so don't hesitate to send me your opinions and tips <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4uVV3q3.gif"/><br>
<br>
the days are going very smoothly and i just baked marshmallows, so i'm a comfy girl <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gnlwVsb.gif"/><br>
i hope everything stays this way until saturday, which is my birthday, because i'll go on a date with my beloved bubu and i want it to be perfect ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
<br>
this post will be full of soft and cozy things, all in a similar aesthetic that i've been wanting to work with for some time, i recommend you eat something sweet to get into it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hq0iHtO.gif"/><br>
to start, i've made a new page for the aesthetic book !<br>

i think this activity is very good for practicing dealing with aesthetics other than my main one, and as i've been aiming to improve my "beautifying" skills i'm doing my best to try different things while maintaining my individuality.<br>
do you think i'm doing well ?<br>
<br>
the melody i used this time was this one :<br>

it's soft and friendly, just like a teddy bear, so i think it fits well <img src="https://i.imgur.com/x3yjjEc.gif"/><br>
<br>
and talking about teddy bears, i had a sudden idea when i saw my png folder and realized that i had a lot of stuffed animals in there ( 56 specifically )<br>
i had to do something with them urgently, they can't just be homeless and all over the place <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dwoRLsQ.gif"/><br>
so i started to make a html page that was comfortable to store them, organizing my virtual stuffie collection !!!<br>

with, of course, a cute url ( bear.shop.tm )<br>
i really enjoyed doing it and i'm very pleased with the result. did you like it ♡ ?<br>
<br>
today i want to write some important tips to you who often feel dissociated and confused with your very existence.<br>
it is a very complicated subject, but i know what i'm going to say here is a good introduction to reflections and learning that you will have to follow on your own ; getting started is usually difficult so i'll say the method i chose to better understand myself, my passions and goals.<br>
will i really be able to help someone with these words ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gy3kOEy.gif"/><br>
i wish from the bottom of my heart !<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i know that the pursuit of self-knowledge is something that never ends, but i, being young, realize that young people usually seek to be special in some way, seeking individuality. the thing is that we are all different and have individualities already, if you don't know which ones you can't enjoy this right, you can't be yourself and improve, so you just become artificial and sad. adults also don't usually know who they are, they just let it go, it makes them more and more faded, which is extremely sad. feeling dissociated and not knowing who you are is a bad feeling and should not be taken to life, so i will try to help you by saying how i managed to understand who i really am and my individuality, i hope it can help some of you too !<br>
something that helped me a lot to understand who i am were the aesthetics. i know this is a very recent term and it may seem rather silly and superficial, but you can call it other things too, since it has always existed : style, spectrum, tendency, essence.. i like to call it aesthetics because i am quite visual, but you must understand that what i mean by that is the essence of who you are, represented through visuals, personality, lifestyle, passions and others.<br>
we are very stimulated seeing beautiful and wonderful things everywhere, aesthetics that we want for ourselves. the problem is that we can not be all things, although we have different moods and personal tastes, there are limits to who we can be ; when you go beyond these limits you feel dissociated and uncomfortable. only you can know who you really are and when you're not being yourself, so you must first learn to understand your feelings and not be carried away by the desires of being someone different, you are perfect being who you are, people are beautiful and perfect in different ways ( and only when they are being themselves ).<br>
you certainly have personal tastes and should not suppress them to fit into groups, your personal tastes help you a lot to understand your personal essence ( we don't really can choose to like things voluntarily, we just like it ). i discovered who i am separating my personal tastes : whenever i had to choose a color, a music, a food, a place, above all others, although i like lots of different things, i always had a specific preference , there was a clear pattern in these things, despite different moods. in this way, through experimentation, i was able to discover my favorite aesthetic. and i must say, you will not find yours coming from someone else, you will only find elements that will compose your personal aesthetic. aesthetics carry specific messages and feelings, so you must understand what you are looking for.<br>
it may seem confusing, but for example, i started by just liking cute, delicate, and feminine things ; within that there may be infinite variations, so i sometimes felt confused and uncomfortable with some cute things that did not really match me. "but i like cute stuff, what's the problem ??" i thought. the problem is that i am me, i am a person, people are complex. i began to realize that i felt artificial when trying to adhere some elements that didn't represent me ( despite being visually alike, carried different feelings ). gradually i separated the elements and composed some aesthetics that i really liked and i felt comfortable about it, until i discovered my ult fav one.<br>
i have a tip for you : always think about the adjectives that define things, these adjectives should complement and make sense to you, should be pleasant and make you feel good ( even the negative ones ). you must do this with all things, not just with visuals, since your essence is present in all the things that make up you.<br>
by understanding who you are, it will be much easier to self improve, you will be able to have healthier relationships and help people, you will have better self esteem, you will better understand your personality ( and therefore take better care of yourself as you will understand your limits ), you will be able to find hobbies, to find out what you want to do with your life, you will be happier and will continue to be free to enjoy things that "don't fit" your main aesthetic, since this is also part of your individuality and should not be denied. as i always say here, you must always seek purity.<br>
i would like to make it clear that you should think about yourself rather than what others feel about you or how other people "should" see you. only you can know yourself deeply and truthfully. people should see you as you really are, you must be yourself and you should not be a walking lie to please others, therefore you will not please anyone or even yourself ! lies are always bad.<br>
<br><br>
i hope my words are useful ///<br>

i've been feeling so in love these days ♡ !!!<br>
whenever i am i send endless messages of love and appreciation to everyone i admire, in addition to writing lots of poems and love letters to bubu ( my favorite person in the whole world, of course he deserves it )<br>
and in return i always get very heartwaming messages that make me blush <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0yHKPnX.gif"/><br>
if you feel like spreading love, always do it !<br>
don't keep compliments just for yourself, let who you love know how much you love them<br>
( if you're shy, do it anonymously, but always do it )<br>
<br>
so today i'm going to post here updates of the last two projects, because yes, i updated them all !<br>
and i intend to continue updating from time to time, but i will give myself some time to rest because i really worked hard doing all this <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aTV14Rn.gif"/><br>
for the soft collection i did a little "study" with a drawing of <i>umibenobochi</i>.<br>
the soft girl featured this time is 142 ♡<br>
i painted with pastels and added different types of paper and also a satin ribbon :<br>

i want today's q&a to be useful to some of you, although it is a personal reflection, i know it is also a subject not much thought and discussed, so i think it's good to share with you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ac6UGRe.gif"/><br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i think it's really important to write about it because it's something that has disturbed me all my life and i've always kept quiet about it because no one would take it seriously anyway.<br>
people live by money, they act as if money is everything in life. even if they pretend they don't, they always think of money in the first place ( of course, until they have real problems in their lives and money doesn't help ).<br>
ever since i was little i have always been bothered by the importance that all adults gives to money, but they have always told me " you will understand when you grow up ". well, i grew up, and reflecting a lot on what i want to do with my life, i definitely know that i do not want to live looking for money until my death.<br>
how important is money to our lives ? to begin with, we are living beings, so we must survive in the first place. to survive, we need food, water, shelter, medicine, cleaning products, clothes... nowadays it is also quite necessary to have electricity.<br>
secondly, we need to be happy, of course, because we have feelings and we think a lot about things, so we need to feel satisfied ! i believe that to be happy is a very personal thing, but in general we need to have peace in our hearts. this is not bought for money, of course. we need to feel comfortable and complete, the pursuit of this is different for each person. in general, we want the presence of people we love in our lives, and this may need money, but not so much, usually the longing is caused more by the lack of time or health of people. some people seek happiness through material goods, which may indeed be quite amusing, but should never be treated as essential because it is not. never. it's the silly, futile thing to expect to be happy, to be sad for the lack of material goods is totally meaningless if you think about it.<br>
sure, then to be happy it's not necessary to have much money but rather own knowledge and inner peace ; but we need money to survive. of course you can't just run away from money if you were born into society. if you live in a big city, you need to pay bills to have water, shelter and electricity, you need to go to the market to buy food and cleaning products, you have to spend money on medicines and hospitals, you have to buy clothes ! well, it is possible to avoid much of this if you live in the countryside and can have water and food and even produce electricity, because we are intelligent human beings and we have nature in our favor, with effort we can enjoy it a lot. but you will still need money for other things.<br>
i know what i'm writing are obvious things, but people don't usually think about them, which makes them very confused about life and how money should be used and what it really is for. it exists to be exchanged for important things that we can not produce alone, that we need the help of other people. we can't do everything on our own, and so humans live collectively, to help each other and to fulfill our needs, so we can survive much longer and have time to be happy. or so it should be, of course. things go wrong when people forget what is important to them and what they want and like to do. people can not be happy because they think only of money and what they have been taught to do.<br>
to make money we need to help other people by doing something they want to pay for. there are many options for this, some are more stable and some less stable. there are many reasons for this, i do not know much about economics, politics or anything like that, but in my view one of the reasons is because some forms of work are extremely indirect, you are not helping anyone really, maybe even being a nuisance. this makes your job a bit pointless, so it's easily disposable and replaceable. people think of this part ( the job ) as super important to their lives and ironically treat it in the worst possible way : they think about what can make more money, neither what makes them happy nor other people happy. money should never be the focus of your life, since this job will be something that will occupy a good part of your life and should be something that helps other people, it should be something pleasurable, rewarding. you can choose from endless options of jobs, why choose to be a slave to money or have a purposeless and unstable work ? i just can't understand.<br>
obviously many things that we enjoy so so so much are things that are not so useful to others and do not give much money, so we call them hobbies. i would not recommend trying to make a hobbie-type your source of money to survive, as that would give you extreme instability in life and make you very frustrated not to have the work valued. some people can actually make it work, but to have the time and dedication to make it happen it is necessary to survive in that period. if you are supported by someone, you can do this, but it is indeed complicated. BUT it doesn't mean that you should stop with your hobbies or treat them as something small in any way, they are still important, just not your main job.<br>
thinking about all these things made me define what i want to do with my life ( the answer was the simplest, since these are things i always wanted to do, i just needed to figure out if this would work, of course ) : i definitely do not want to be a slave to money, i will never think of money as something to give life and happiness. i just want to do things that i like and i'm proud to do. that doesn't mean it will be easy, i'm going to have a lot of work and i'm going to try hard to make it work, but with a bright smile on my face !<br>
i want to live a little away from the city, because i want to plant and raise animals. i have several plans on this and i know it's rather complex, but i've been planning a lot for several years, since it's something i've always wanted to do since i was little. i can tell you the details about some things if you want, of course, only practice can teach me what this kind of life can offer me, but it's really what i want. and i never thought it was something that could give me money since i always grew up having my dreams devalued and being encouraged to work on boring things to have money. i'm glad i never took it seriously and i always followed my heart.<br>
i already told you that i want to have a cafe, right ? so, this is part of the whole thing, since it also involves food. i believe that selling food in general is quite stable and will be extremely enjoyable to me. the part where the cafe is also a store, is the part where my hobbies are included, since i do not want to abandon them !<br>
money, being something quite vague and used only to buy important things that help us survive and possibly have extra entertainment, is something that at the moment i am exclusively using with the intention of realizing my dreams and having a source of happy income and stability. in the future, i know that i will have money to also buy beautiful things and travel, but that will only be because i worked hard and made the right choices : i chose to follow my heart, to help people and to be happy.<br>
do not choose to live for the money, do not be sad because of money, never !!!<br>
<br><br>
i hope this helps you to reflect on your life choices and think about whether you are really choosing happiness.<br>
i know a lot of young people read my blog, so i really wish you were not influenced by the sad, greedy adults around you ; ;<br>
um and i'm sorry if i wrote too much unnecessarily ////<br>
