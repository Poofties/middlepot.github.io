hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZhgJgb8.gif"/><br>
i'm so excited ♡ !!!<br>
i'm finally ready to start my online store, shy bunny <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FYD71ij.gif"/><br>
i took pictures of all the items and i will post them in the next days !<br>
i'm going to do disclosure on my main fb page, which has similar aesthetics, and i also plan to make a giveaway.<br>
unfortunately, for now, this store only works for brazil, but i can deliver small items to other places if anyone has an interest. just contact me ♡<br>
i'm organizing everything the best i can <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dy3FvOr.gif"/><br>
<br>
so.. there are lots of political issues going on because of the elections here ; ;<br>
very stressful <img src="https://i.imgur.com/b44NCpX.gif"/><br>
i would like to make it clear that i don't like to give opinions on politics, economics or any subjects that i don't have proper knowledge to write about.<br>
i know it is important, but i don't feel comfortable posting opinions on subjects that i have not studied properly, i hope you understand !!<br>
( i'll add this to the faq )<br>
<br>
going back to the fun subject, i plan to post lots of cute crafts from now on !!<br>
i'm very happy about this, since it is something as important to me as my digital works.<br>
lately i've been pretty excited about trying different aesthetics for decoration, i'm always saving new material and i get inspired easily !<br>
i always have real strong tendencies for decorating everything with my main aesthetic ( because it always warms my heart right away ), but i believe my secondary aesthetics also represent important parts of who i am. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vVXYiJQ.gif"/><br>
i think they deserve some love too ♡<br>
i'm having lots of fun trying new color combinations, different textures... i feel that i'm improving a lot.<br>
today i'm going to show you a very nice chubby teddy bear, that will be in the store :<br>

isn't he adorable ♡ ?<br>
i just feel like squeezing him and giving him lots of kisses <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1DEhCyG.gif"/><br>
<br>
i also have something today that i've been forgetting to do for a long time ( i'm sorry /// )<br>
i recorded an audio in portuguese, with the story of the "pink little bug", that i wrote !<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
it's so much more comfortable to record in portuguese, really...<br>
i think it's a good story for before bed, what do you think ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bSzCqHQ.gif"/><br>
<br>
i would also like to post here a simple drawing that i painted.<br>
it's really nothing special, i was just bored, but i think it's cute and nostalgic <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2UJaqr0.gif"/><br>

do you also think painting is relaxing ?<br>
i absolutely love painting ♡<br>
<br>
in this post i have an important thing to talk with you, besides the main q&a subject.<br>
i want to talk about why i gave up using the feedback buttons on my website, as well as the hit counter !<br>
( yes, a lot of text lately, i hope it's not a problem ; ; )<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ⅰഒ<br>
since i wrote my "honest post" to you i reflected a lot about my attitudes. whenever i write something i do it initially to improve myself. i changed the way i treat my photos, i felt the need to clarify a lot of confusing things for you about personality and behavior that might be useful.. but i still felt very upset about the numbers on that site.<br>
i decided a few days ago that i want to stop using the feedback buttons as well as the hit counter. i've never really liked the idea of ​​exposed numbers because people always take them too seriously, above the quality of content... they really think that numbers represent something important when in fact it's not realistic or impartial ; ;<br>
i started using them because i liked to have feedback, but i think it turned out to be something not very relevant at some point... i'm not devaluing your clicks, but i prefer feedbacks with constructive words, tips and opinions, not just one approval or disapproval number. this has not really helped me improve, it's nothing compared to the messages i get. people are not numbers, they are individuals with real and important opinions and feelings. i want real opinions.<br>
to be honest, i was very happy to see the numbers growing, but i know that they don't represent much of anything other than the site is growing in visits ( which is good, but overvalued ). the numbers are mostly positive, and i feel extremely happy about it, but it's definitely exaggerated. reading true and honest messages from the visitors proved infinitely more enriching for me, even the shorter messages were written by someone who really wanted to give their opinion.<br>
social media have created this need for big numbers in people and even after partially abandoning social media altogether i have tried to use the feedback button system in my favor here, and it was quite useful at first, but i feel that i don't have more reasons to keep it here than to praise a false reputation for my image on the internet. i'm just a normal person doing my best, just like any other producer on any other website. i reflected a lot on this and people treating me differently because of numbers is not something that i value and i don't think is good for me or the visitors. the race for numbers and fame is not the kind of thing i'd be proud to encourage on my site ( or anywhere else, but unfortunately that's not always an option ).<br>
i kept the numbers exposed despite not approving their overvaluation because i believed it could bring public ; maybe people could took me more seriously if i had big numbers ? maybe they could allow themselves to look at the site more easily if they saw this "seal of approval" from previous visitors ?<br>
... but is it really worth blinding people with such superficial information and then saying it's not important ?<br>
i have come to the conclusion that i must be an example and show that appreciation of numbers is not healthy or productive.<br>
i felt free from this race for numbers as i moved away from social media, and i discovered over time that frequent visitors of my site are not here either by the numbers, but by the content, just as they are on other interesting sites and blogs of the internet. it definitely warms my heart to know that neatly my work honestly attracts so many people ♡<br>
so, i removed the feedback buttons from all the pages of the site ( except, of course, from the archives ) and made some changes to the layouts ( because i'm inspired ). i removed the hit counter from the index, although i still know how many ips visits my site, this is more for technical information. i'm going to increase the frequency with which the chat is open, so i decided to keep only one of them, moving the messages and smilies from the look book chat to the main chat, so i can have more control over it. consider these changes as a purification, it's extremely invigorating to be free of ego needs and social fears ~<br>
i hope hiding the numbers and keeping the written feedback in evidence is more productive for me and for you ! i wish from the bottom of my heart that you participate more avidly in this site, and not in the form of numbers, but as wonderful and real angels, which is what you are to me. ♡<br>
( remembering that i love exchanging long emails and letters, so be sure to get in touch with me at letters@middlepot.com if you want to talk to me )<br>
<br>

　ⅱഒ<br>
this subject is not so questioned but some people are curious to know what religion i have, since i occasionally write things that seem kinda religious..<br>
basically, i'm a paganist ! i do not consider myself anything more than that. i am a daughter of mother nature ; nature is my god and goddess, it's everything to me. nature guides me in all difficult times and has always helped me to make the right decisions, nature makes me feel at home wherever i am, it is because of her that i'm learning to see beauty in all things and to value the things that really matter and that make me happy. following my role in nature is my dream and guiding others to happiness & comfort is my passion ♡ !<br>
i often thank nature for everything i am blessed to enjoy in the most unexpected moments. i make prayers to bring good energies to the ones i love. i feel a lot of motherhood in nature and so i usually refer to it in a feminine way, but nature also has paternity depending on the moment so referring in a masculine way can happen. i have always been very attached to nature and mythology has always been a very great interest, i have always believed from the bottom of my heart in magic and in the magical beings who secretly play their role in nature & i utterly love to make offerings for these beings who take care of me and of whom i love. i also greatly appreciate sympathies and rituals that bring good energies and help us connect with nature. i usually do these things from my heart, instinctively, so i'm not part of communities or specific religion within paganism, although reading about these things is something i absolutely love doing.<br>
i always feel a very strong bond with fairies, angels and rabbits. i believe there are some particularities of my being that are the same as theirs, so i identify a lot even though i am a human. the role of the fairies in nature, the protective wings of the angels, the purity and maternity of the rabbits... these are virtues that i long for ♡ !<br>
i believe in faith as much as in fate. in my view, both are forces that work in our lives. when fate is absolute and yet your faith goes beyond limits, that's how miracles happen. i believe that the destiny is something that has no relation to us and where is our luck, as long as faith is composed of energies that make up our essence ; so we can also mess up our luck with negative thoughts, it's important to be careful with our feelings.<br>
i unhesitatingly believe in afterlifes, i don't have a clear vision of what it is, but i believe it is certainly something very fruitful for our soul, full of new opportunities ! i also believe in other types of lives simultaneously happening, in secret from us ( other realities and other worlds, like our dream world ).<br>
lastly, i would like to comment that i believe that all religions and personal beliefs of each person are important and that if the person is being guided to be better each day, they are certainly following the right path. i accept with all my heart any prayer and good blessings that anyone sends me. i love feeling connected in peace with other people so i love all kinds of expressions of affection, religious or not ♡<br>
<br>
i wish you all the joy and solace !!!<br>

aaa ♡ i have good news, and some updates !!<br>
i got a new camera, i'm so excited, i already took some beautiful pictures <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j2HpytF.gif"/><br>
i used to take pictures with my old phone or my mom's camera, which is good, but it was not always possible, so it kept me from taking pictures of some specific things like some of my crafts and.. well, myself.<br>
because of that, my pictures were usually inconsistent quality and it bothered me a lot ; ;<br>
i felt insecure and confused about posting my pics so many were randomly posted on my tumblr or facebook pages ///<br>
so now, i decided to organize my folders and just kept the beautiful, good quality pics. i deleted a lot of old stuff and even updated the look book page, the "about" pic and the portfolio.<br>
i decided to just make one session for my pictures in the look book and make them temporary ( i usually get tired of looking at old photos at some point so i know they will be deleted sometime ).<br>
this session will be for pictures of myself in general, because i don't really take pics of my looks or my face often, but more "specific" pics. i never knew where to post these here, so now i have a place.<br>
some old pics will be reposted from time to time, so i will not specify dates !<br>
i still don't think i'll post selfies often anyway, and i'll keep taking pictures with pajamas and nightgowns, because as i've said before, it's how i usually feel comfortable. also, i probably will not stop posting some pics anonymously out there.. i'm very shy, sorry ///<br>
i still have lots of updates to do about it + i'll post my crafts more often, so stay tuned ♡ !<br>
<br>
as you may have noticed, i also made some changes to my inactive accounts.<br>
i deleted my already inactive 8tracks acc, i had not deleted until today because i used to listen to some playlists there, but the site changes completely prevented me from doing this and i was annoyed.. there was no reason to continue there, since i couldn't even listen to my own playlists... <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fx1iziF.gif"/><br>
i also updated some images and erased some unnecessary posts in my facebook profile. i still keep it to keep in touch with some people over there + manage the pages.<br>
about the instagram account i decided to clean it completely and change everything, including the name. i did this because looking at the the old pictures were making me uncomfortable, they were not very good. also, i was getting many messages from confused people with my absence. i'll keep the acc because i want to keep in touch with some people, besides i always see very beautiful content there !<br>
i hope these changes haven't been uncomfortable for anyone, i just like to keep things organized ///<br>
<br>
now, i have a ( kinda old ) sketch that i painted recently :<br>

<br><br>
do you like when i post papercrafts here ?<br>
i plan to post more crafts in future posts.<br>
<br>
so today what's going to be double !<br>
the first text is about something i felt the need to talk about but that is not reeeally a subject : about my arguments in my texts in general.<br>
then i also wrote about a second subject : immigration. this topic seems to be "feared" by some people nowadays, but i think it's relevant to talk about it because it's in some way a reality in my life and will also include information about my future plans that you were curious about, so let's just get into it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j9db2cK.gif"/><br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ⅰ.<br>
people who read my huge texts here may notice that my arguments for all subjects have some patterns, i might say, characteristic of me.<br>
i always explain my reasonings to the conclusions, opinions, and "solutions to problems" that i arrive at ; but this doesn't seem to be clear enough to explain why i always think in a specific way and come up with texts that are so deep, sentimental and at the same time logical.<br>
the thing is exactly that ! i take into consideration all the parts that make up who i am. i am a human being who has rationality to be able to reflect on things and observe situations with an "impartial", rational and logical perception ; but i also have feelings, which are what guide me to questioning things and wanting to be happy, helping me and helping those i love, by getting answers to problems. despite having the sentimental side clearly stronger than the rational one, i strive to balance both when thinking about things and also to write my texts, so that i can get more consistent and useful answers. i don't always get it right because i have hormones that affect my cognitive ability from time to time, i'm an animal ( female, which makes me on the other hand get particular facility in other things, which i also try to make the most of ) but i only write my texts when i am in the mood to reach balanced conclusions.<br>
i think what makes the difference in my arguments to most people is that although i know that i am not the most mature and experienced person, not having much knowledge in specific areas, i always look for answers within myself and in the nature, which is what inevitably controls us. we are all composed of mind, body and soul ; our mind carry the ability to rationalize, our body carry feelings and instincts, our soul carry our pure essence. people usually focus on the part they are most comfortable using and form arguments based on that particular part, but that causes problems ; ;<br>
if you just focus on the mind you will make arguments that are insensitive, extreme and that will not bring happiness ; if you focus on the feelings you will make arguments that will not be useful, perhaps childish and very melancholy ; if you focus on the instincts you will make primitive and inconsistent arguments ; if you focus on the soul you will make arguments that are usually religious and too abstract to be understood. what i strive to do is to use the feelings ( which are my strength ) to guide me through the questions, then use all the other parts to form my arguments and respond to the problems consistently and clearly. my arguments are gentle and soft, natural, extremely sincere and even without having great academic background it's not just "all over the place". it's always thought to bring me happy and working responses, even though we are animals and nature is neutral, we can understand and work with it if we use all the parts that make us up properly.<br>
i know that my texts are focused on being personal and may not work for many people because they have opinions of their own, and i always encourage you to reflect personally to find your own answers. anyway, i think my way to get to the arguments in a balanced way is a healthy practice and i recommend it to everyone ♡ !<br>
i'm utterly happy to know that you like to read what i write, since it's something that comes from my heart ( and everything else ).<br>
<br>
<br>
　ⅱ.<br>
this is a complex subject and currently controversial so i'll start by explaining my point of view before talking about my personal experience :<br>
animals evolve over time to adapt to the places where they live, animals have always immigrated ( intentionally or unintentionally ) to the entire planet and this gives us the variety of species breeds we see today. with humans it was not different, our different races and physical types exist because we are animals that had to adapt evolving in the past, when this was very necessary ; not that it's no longer necessary since we continue in this process, but our small physical differences don't affect us in a very relevant way nowadays because we have been able to adapt our homes, clothes, food and everything necessary according to the local needs. this allows us to be able to survive anywhere in the world ( the more money, the more quality of life, if you choose a "difficult" place for you ).<br>
because of this, i completely support immigration, even though humans ( like all other animals ) have a "proper" place in the world according to their races and physical type, we don't need to follow these adaptations as long as we have the technology needed for our quality of life. i support that people can live wherever they want, out of necessity or for fun, we are all free to come and go on planet earth since we can have comfort through our efforts as a rational species ( for this reason, there are also no problems in being mixed nowadays ).<br>
my family and my descendants are made up of people from europe who came to brazil at a time when living there was very bad, while here was a wonderful and very comfortable place. it was the best choice for them at the time, and i don't think they did anything wrong because my family lived very well in the old days because of it. but a common problem especially in this type of drastic immigration ( from a completely different place to another ) is that future generations will find themselves in an increasingly worse situation of adaptation. my family doesn't have very good financial situation these days, and as i said earlier, if the place on earth is difficult for you to adapt, it takes more money to supply your needs.<br>
currently, living in brazil is not good for me or my family, we are not comfortable in many ways. our food is good but the weather is really a nuisance for me, although i absolutely loving the blue sky and the birds that live on my roof and sing every morning all year long, loving my mother tongue, loving many local foods and fruits ( that i'll take with me wherever i live ); the summers are getting more and more uncomfortable. but this is the "small" personal reason why i want to go back to europe ; i really want to form a family and the violence in my country is really something frighteningly common, besides the fact that the country is also not economically well. these are many problems that used to exist when my great great grandparents suffered when they decided to live in brazil. i want to go back to europe to give my children a good life and to be happier ♡ !<br>
fortunately, i can do that, and obviously i support that kind of attitude and i think immigration is great in many ways. they can cause problems for future generations, as it did for me, but this can be solved with more immigration and it is not something that has "ruined" my family or something, as some people often imagine ( ??? )<br>
i like brazil as well as i like anywhere else in the world, it is a beautiful and special place and i have obviously a special affection for this place has been where i was born and lived until today, but europe is where i want to live now and i think it's a good choice for being my "home" location, biologically speaking.<br>
besides, i would like to comment on other "immigration" details that relate to humans... i don't support raising animals or plants in very different places from their natural habitat unless it's done in a comfortable environment under carefully adaptation, and obviously without overloading the environment ( large-scale agriculture or animal breeding that are not locally appropriate affect the environment and are harmful to literally everyone, i utterly disapprove of these practices ).<br>
<br>
well, that's it, i hope i've expressed myself clearly !!<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rg8poHP.gif"/><br>
i realize how this website has grown since its creation and i am very proud of the progress <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3SNUoL5.gif"/><br>
i'm doing my best to bring frequent updates and useful content to you !!<br>
please ask me complex questions to write about, it's hard to think about subjects that seem relevant..<br>
i get many questions that would not really do a good q&a, you know ?<br>
<br>
you know that i have a routine page, i have schedules to do certain things and daily tasks, this helps me a lot to organize things, as well as my weekly listings and schedules.<br>
of course life doesn't always collaborate and we have to make adaptations, but it is great to have a base to know what to do and not waste time.<br>
so, i've been trying hard to spend less time on the internet lately !<br>
if i'm forced to do this i always find a way to do everything in a short time, but it is difficult to have discipline when i have free time ; ;<br>
some of my tasks require the internet, so i defined a period of 3 hours a day as the maaaaximum time on the internet, on those more complicated days ; but i usually spend 2 hours or even 1 hour and i'm very happy about it ♡ !<br>
it's a very important practice, especially for those who do many "quiet" activities like me, it is necessary to space these times to stretch, drink water, make snacks and take some air outside.<br>
in fact, i would like to clarify that i don't really wake up 6 am going to sleep 1 am, it would be torture.. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NtMNFpN.gif"/><br>
i just get up to watch the sunrise ( when it's possible, i really like doing it ), so i also eat a fruit and plan my day ; if it's very hot i like to take a shower to refresh, then i go back to sleep until 10 am !<br>
i just really wake up at 6 am if i need to and in that case i always go to bed before midnight.<br>
<br>
i was writing lots of letters lately and thinking.. sometimes i get a little annoyed with my handwriting because it's very... childish <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Clflx9p.gif"/><br>
i don't know how to explain, i don't think it's ugly, it's kinda cute ; but it's a little clumsy, small and "roundy", it's the same handwriting that i see in my old school notebooks !!<br>
if you have already exchanged letters with me or have already seen my handwriting fonts you will understand.<br>
( by the way, if you are interested in exchanging letters don't hesitate to contact me in the email because i love doing this ♡ )<br>
i really like calligraphy so i train a lot, i like to write in different letters to make decorated titles and "aesthetic" texts, but my natural handwriting really is childish and there's nothing i can do about it ; ;<br>
they say people's handwriting reflects their personality, i know everyone has a unique handwriting that is a "brand" of them and that's very special ♡<br>
but it is impossible not to envy people who have naturally mature and elegant handwriting ///<br>
well, i can "simulate" this if i really want to, but it's not the same since it inevitably doesn't suit me very much so i usually just prefer to be myself.<br>
<br>
enough of talking, today the post will have a super cute drawing that i painted ♡ !<br>

i know that compared to the last posts full of content this seems a little bit meh but i'm really busy with bigger things right now <img src="https://i.imgur.com/138iVRv.gif"/><br>
<br>
today's q&a is something sweet and positive for you ♡<br>
hmnfg i hope it doesn't seem pretentious or anything like that <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HUaeQ0l.gif"/><br>

<br><br>
have you ever seen people who are so beautiful, kind and have a lovely aura that makes everyone feel comfortable and safe around ? it seems like a rare and precious personality trait, like this person knows nothing bad and lives in a beautiful and different reality.<br>
in fact, i have learned over time that this is a skill to be acquired with maturity. bad experiences don't influence who you really are and shouldn't make you have a heavy and sad aura. bad experiences happen for you to mature and to be able to avoid them in the future, as well as helping other people in a similar situation ; traumas are not part of you, all bad things you've been through, you've seen or just know that exist, none of that is part of you and none of that represents your reality.<br>
you should never become ignorant, keep yourself informed of the world situation and mold your opinions is very important to live healthy and safe ! however, it is extremely important to keep yourself pure despite all this. purity will give you a different aura and will make your reality, in fact, beautiful.<br>
don't let bad thoughts and memories affect you continuously ; boring and ugly things are a part of life and you really should deal with them properly and don't ignore them, but you should not make them a personal problem. on daily basis you should forget everything bad and only think of beautiful and pleasant things that you live, lived and would like to live : daydream, watch the sky, pick flowers, write love letters, wear perfume, put on pajamas all day, wear your favorite dress casually ! life has many opportunities for you to make it beautiful and create good memories for you to keep and share with others.<br>
surround yourself with beautiful things, embellish ugly things you don't like to look at, cherish people who love you & move away from people who are toxic to you. small details in your life can greatly help shaping your ability to be positive and emanate kindness and beauty ♡<br>
<br>
remember : the kinder you are, the more beautiful you become ( and that includes being kind to yourself )<br>
