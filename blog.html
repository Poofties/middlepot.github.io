hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NJAC8XR.gif"/><br>
do you have the xmas spirit <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WpkdfFD.gif"/>?<br>
i'm willing to bring this comfort and warmth to you through this post ♡<br>
as you know, where i live is summer right now, which is very anticlimatic ; ;<br>
i always have difficulties getting into the xmas mood, but i love the xmas SO much !!!!<br>
i always start to live it as soon as halloween is over ( i really love halloween too, by the way )<br>
one of my biggest dreams is to have a white xmas.<br>
i really hope for the day when i will have my first white xmas, and maybe, all the next ones too !<br>
the snow is something magical that i really need to see, it's so important to me ;///;<br>
i wish i could see nature in all its splendor, in its completeness...<br>
if you can have snow where you live, i know that you maybe is used it, but please enjoy this vision and live this experience having in mind that it is something really special !!<br>
<br>
changing the subject, i've been thinking a lot about how i take criticism into consideration, but i especially pay close attention to negative criticism..<br>
i really do believe these are very useful for my personal improvement, but i think i've begun to take generalized negative criticism into consideration, which is a no no <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8eY00cR.gif"/><br>
for example, when people generally talk negative things about humans, girls, anything that applies to me, i keep evaluating my behavior to see if i'm doing these bad things too<br>
the problem is that even when i realize that i am not doing anything bad, at all, and that the comment was true but generalized, i still feel sad because the image of who i am is at first bad, right ?<br>
i think it's important for my maturation to realize that people's opinions can really be very negative about me at first, but if they are not true, i should not be worrying about it. it only hurts me.<br>
it's natural to people who generalize opinions and stereotype things and people, and if these are bad things, i naturally have to overcome them by myself, and not try to "clean the image" of all people, if after all, they are not doing their best too.<br>
i think this is an important lesson !!<br>
<br>
do you also evaluate your behavior frequently ?<br>
being the best that i can makes me very happy, but it's tiring when i'm being too strict with myself ///<br>
i will focus on giving my best to give pride to those who know me <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZOQNPSP.gif"/><br>
it's hard to think a lot, but i feel very lucky to be a person and be able to have my heart connected with those i love & with nature ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
i want my feelings to reach you, especially this xmas <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SG2ZwhZ.gif"/><br>
<br>
now i would like to show you a very special playlist that i made to enter the xmas mood :<br>
<br><br>

<br>
<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br>
i hope it can warm your hearts too ♡<br>
there are only songs that are really special to me and that bring me sweet memories !<br>
consider it as my present for you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/A7i3ZBP.gif"/><br>
<br>
i would like to comment that i have received some line stickers recently, from bubu, and i feel so identified with them ! it's literally me !!!<br>
besides the appearance, i really always identified myself in some way with alice !<br>
i especially identify with the feeling of dissociation, lack of reality and irritability that she shows in the course of the story.<br>
i think my life was very marked by that, and it was a way for me to be able to understand who i really am and to deal with the world around me, while understanding what fantasies are and their power over reality !<br>
okay, i may be going a little far ///<br>
anyway, here she is :<br>

today, the q&a will not be double, but i hope you like the subject i chose !<br>
i think it can be very motivational and clarifying.<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
i always see people talking about the girls' rivalry very aggressively, as if girls hated and competed with each other all the time.. i've been thinking a lot about it because i've always seen rivalry in a positive way in my life, but it was not always positive. i think i've come up with an explanation about it that makes a lot of sense :<br>
to begin with, girls naturally rival each other, differently than boys do. boys also compete, but usually in more objective situations, as in a specific competition or at a specific point to achieve a goal. this type of competition is what we see in games, for example. it's frustrating if you lose, but however mature enough to deal with, that's okay ; it's nothing personal. this type of competition happens between boys and girls alike, but it is not the same as female rivalry.<br>
female rivalry is something very subjective, and that's exactly why it's so interesting, and productive. when girls compare themselves with others in an objective way, they feel sad and can feel envy, which is bad and destructive to self-esteem and relationships ; but this is just a wrong and immature way of dealing with female rivalry ! it doesn't have to be this way ; ;<br>
i've suffered comparing myself directly to other girls, but i've learned that healthy rivalry is when you compare yourself subjectively. all girls tend to have life goals that are naturally very subjective, which even they can't perceive. it's those kinds of goals that you couldn't write exactly in a list and just take some steps to get there - in fact, you might never get there - and that's extremely motivating ♡ !!!<br>
comparing yourself to other girls looking at them as inspirations and looking at their achievements as motivation is something that always makes me feel very happy and inspired to be a better girl as well. to be a better person. i feel extremely motivated when i meet a girl who has life goals similar to mine ( things like being a purer, gentler, wiser person ) and on the same level that i feel that i don't want to lose to her, i don't want to be behind her, i want to reach her !! just as i want to be free to follow my own path, not hers ; i want to be just as a good girl as she is, not to be exactly like her. i want to be myself, the best i can be. seeing other girls being the best they can be fills my heart with joy and i definitely consider them rivals ! i want them to get better every day, just like me ♡ !!<br>
the rivalry between girls is something wonderful and incredible, not for compare us objectively, but subjectively.<br>
<br>
do you fluffies agree on what i wrote ?<br>
please, give me your opinions and additions ♡ !<br>
i wish you all the most beautiful and peaceful xmas !!!<br>

i feel absolutely soft these days ~<br>
i have learned a lot about patience and self control, but mostly about self care !<br>
i'm pretty anxious when it comes to being productive, i'd say i'm almost addicted to that sense of accomplishment after having a busy day.<br>
the problem is that i always felt useless when i was in my spare time ; ;<br>
this is not healthy, so i'm trying my best to respect the free hours of my day as much as the working hours, after all, both are important <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ayl9a7S.gif"/><br>
i'm also feeling that i'm getting more and more free of the "physical" things... even though they really matter to me, i know that too much bonding to them emotionally makes me feel needy easily, which is not good at all !<br>
it is definitely essential to remember that the most important things are not physical, because naturally, what makes us feel like home is where our heart is, not our body <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YYQfh8r.gif"/><br>
<br>

my ult fav aesthetic, i adore it ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
<br>
today, double q&a !<br>
first subject is about trauma coping issues, second one about virtual world issues.<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ణ ⅰ<br>
this subject is very specific but i feel i should express myself about it, since i see many people with weird and even disgusting kinks, aesthetics or artistic expressions, justifying it as a way of "coping trauma". i don't particularly think it's completely wrong, but very controversial and dangerous.<br>
i follow some trauma blogs and i see many toxic people in this environment, as well as people who are harmed or treated bad for posting controversial stuff.<br>
any kind of trauma or sensitivity to some bad, disgusting, dangerous, ugly subjects in general can become an obstacle in people's lives. no one wants to feel dirty or bad. it is natural trying to deal with such experiences or thoughts ; trying to romanticize, normalize, or even sexualizate. we want to see beauty and pleasure in ugly things so we don't feel rejection for them and for ourselves and our bad memories, but obviously we need to take responsibility for this type of action and specify the motives, inform people of the problems and risks and not treat as something cute and casual. it's not the kind of content you have the right to post anywhere or spread around the world, no matter how traumatized you are. you have NO RIGHT to bother other people with your confused and romanticized content.<br>
people usually deal with this sort of thing in the form of art, aesthetics and even kinks, there are people who do ugly romanticized things to become their aesthetic and way of life as a way of coping with trauma. this is something natural and there is usually no intention to hurt someone, just to make things simpler ; the problem is that this kind of attitude should not be treated as something simple. people who do this kind of art, people who post on this kind of aesthetics, people who live such lives should not spread to the world what they do as if it were something beautiful and desirable. this type of content, which has "damaged innocence", are something very sensitive, that i support, because they have already helped me a lot, but within specific communities and treated properly, as something very delicate and dangerous.<br>
if you're not aware of what you're doing you can put yourself in danger situations intentionally to try to confront your fears and this is not at all healthy or acceptable, depending on your condition. this is one side where self diagnosis can be dangerous because you really can't handle extreme things in an extreme way without having proper help, but i've already written about that subject. i've also commented about how kinks being treated as a cute and cool "aesthetic" and spread over the internet is a bad thing for influencing young people and being harmful to other people.<br>
when i say that these processes of romanticizing helped me, it is true, it helped me a lot at a time that i was feeling very insecure and dirty because of my sometimes weird, dangerous and controversial desires. i was embarrassed to talk to anyone about it and this kind of romanticized content helped me a lot to understand that i was not a bad person by feeling what i felt, but more importantly, i was educated to know that even though it was "normal" it was not necessarily a right thing to do, or something to be proud of. so it has always been a secret and helped me to mature. over time, i could better understand what i felt and separate harmful things from healthy ones, and so be able to have a better lifestyle ( please don't ask me details about it, it makes me very uncomfortable /// ). it would be extremely hypocritical if i said that romanticizing is always bad, i just think that caution and instructions for such content are fundamental, to prevent this from being a bad influence and worsen people's mental health.<br>
i don't think people really need to have gone through physical traumas to have the "right to coping", that's a very disrespectful opinion ; everyone has the right to overcome their fears and problems, the problem is that when you do it publicly and treat it as something soft and romantic, such as a "broken doll" or "fallen angel", other people are harmed because they will put themselves in danger intentionally and consequently end up traumatized as well.<br>
finally, again, i confirm that i don't think it's wrong to romanticize things or even sexualize them if it makes you feel better, but it is something extremely personal and delicate that must be done with caution and with the notion that suffering is not nice. it may be poetically beautiful, interesting, but it's not something that anyone should desire as it's dangerous and harmful.<br>
and anyway, i think it's good to consult professional help to know if you are coping in a healthy way because each person has particularities when dealing with this type of thing ! please stay safe ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　ణ ⅱ<br>
as you know, i am very involved with the "virtual world". the internet is part of my life and many of my works are digital. even so, i highly value the caution in creating a "virtual identity" just as i think it's sorely primordial to avoid spending too much time on the internet and overvalue the virtual world.<br>
i learned over time that the virtual world may seem "perfect" and incredible, just as it very easily occupies our time ( often not free time ) and entertains us ; but it's also very limited, so it is not worth replacing your "real life" time.<br>
the internet can be very useful for learning new things, interacting with people from all over the world, personal improving, and even for sorts of important jobs and hobbies, which is why i love the internet and value it. but the internet can only stimulate our sight and hearing, and we have five senses. only real life can stimulate all five senses and bring us full life experiences full of sensations and feelings !!<br>
you can't eat freshly picked wild berries, you can't feel the scent of flowers, you can't pet a fluffy animal, you can't hug people you love over the internet. don't substitute your real time for the virtual, it's not worth it. the internet has many limitations, it is inferior in comparison.<br>
and just as all experiences are much more intense and wonderful in real life, you too can only be as perfect and better as possible in real life. the virtual identity that we create exists to allow us to introduce others who are far from us, we can put together the best visuals we can offer and we can also publish works and receive reviews and feedback, we can learn and improve ; but you really are much more special with all the details. your image and voice are not all you have to offer, you in real life are a complete person and if you focus on improving yourself as a whole and not only superficially, you can enjoy the virtual world and the world real in the best way possible : beneficial, fun and above all, healthy ♡ !<br>
<br>
these are subjects that i always see people having confused feelings about, and that also confused me a lot for several years ; ;<br>
it's the kind of thing that gets in the way of our personal development, so i really hope that my texts are useful to you in some way ///<br>

i have great news for you : i decided that i will learn how to sew clothes, like my mom !!<br>
yes, i really want to improve my seamstress skills now.<br>
i decided this when thinking about the topic of fashion and how i love designing my own clothes.. and i don't really know how to sew clothes.<br>
i don't want to depend on my mom forever to sew my clothes and put ideas into practice, so i've decided that i will learn seriously !<br>
i'll start with simple clothes for myself, but as soon as i become more confident i plan to sew things to my store as well <img src="https://i.imgur.com/86tN3lf.gif"/><br>
yes, you will see exclusive clothes and bags at the shy bunny store in the near future ♡ !!!<br>
i'm really excited for this, i know it will be a big improvement for me <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uqX9qnQ.gif"/><br>
my mom is encouraging me a lot and will teach me all the techniques !<br>
it's time to overcome the apprehension with sewing machines... wish me luck ♡<br>
<br>
well, i'd like to make a little break in this post for kefir appreciation !!!<br>
( i don't know how to call them, but i mean the living things that make natural yogurt )<br>
i've been creating kefir for a few months now, and i like them so much <img src="https://i.imgur.com/y5Kfd1j.gif"/><br>
they are like fluffy clouds, and although they consume lots of milk, they always provide me yummy high quality yogurt for me to drink every morning ♡<br>
if you have the opportunity to create a cute cloud colony too, i really recommend.<br>
<br>
so, after that random break.. i have here a colorful, nostalgic and super cute collage !!<br>

<br>
nooow, of course, double q&a !<br>
i wrote very positive and motivating texts this time, the first one is about a positive world view, the second one is about self care.<br>
i wonder if these motivational texts actually help in any way and are not just "temporary positive energy"<br>
i struggle to follow my own advice, if you want to know... it's easy to cry a lot and get mad at everything and everyone <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KWSo2mh.gif"/><br>
but the important thing is to take a deep breath and think before you act not to hurt yourself or other people !<br>
things will not be always easy or positive, right ?<br>
<br><br>

　☾ ⅰ<br>
i want to urgently vent on this, it's so tiring to see people being bitter and negative, i just wanted to say : the world is not ugly.<br>
the world is not a bad place, people are not horrible, life is not sad and tragic, no no no !!!<br>
to begin with, the world is simply neutral. nature works in an extremely balanced way, everything is always in its proper place + bad and good things are equally necessary for everything to work well. it's impossible for a world to be good if only good things exist, i know it's confusing, but good and evil only exist if both exist. and this is something positive !<br>
good experiences are better after bad moments of perseverance to achieve them. dreams are only dreams because they can't be realized right away. the fact that there are bad things and difficulties should be something that motivates you and makes the world interesting and beautiful, not the other way around ; ;<br>
moreover, beauty is something very abstract in general. the world is not really ugly or beautiful, it's neutral because beauty depends on the eyes of the beholder. for example, you may very much like to eat a dish that looks disgusting but has a divine flavor. the "beauty" as we know is something visual, not that it's wrong, since i myself am an extremely visual person and always use this love for beauty to find out more about myself and the world, beautiful things make me feel happy and motivated, i love beauty ; but this is not so important in the world in general.<br>
our sight is something sensitive and if you miss it, it's not as if all the beauty is gone. even if beauty is mostly visual, there is a lot more involved in this concept than we should consider as well. good things are always present in our lives : smells, tastes, sounds, textures... all this is as important as the visual. the beauty is in all this, so it is impossible not to have beauty in all things, no matter how "ugly" it may seem.<br>
the world, life, nature, being perfectly neutral, allow us to take our paths and interpret things as we wish. i consider it healthy enough to be positive and see the usefulness and necessity of bad things as a motivational and educational way, and see good things as blessings to be enjoyed to the fullest, cherished and treasured as nostalgias. i consider the world a perfectly beautiful place because i want to be happy. like, why would i see the bad side of everything on purpose ? this doesn't make sense to me.<br>
my desire is to mature enough to be happy and find beauty and importance in all sorts of things. it's not just a romanticization, it's a way of being able to enjoy life in a healthy and light way, to stay bright and pure no matter what bad experiences you have experienced.<br>
the world is neutral but i consider it the most beautiful thing possible because it is purely perfect exactly as it is. ♡<br>
<br>
to complete this subject, i think people are also very negative when they talk about their bodies... and i'm not even talking about visual insecurities about it, but people really underestimate their bodies. our physical body is not just a bunch of flesh and by chance we're stuck inside it, it makes me sad when people talk like that, it's so disrespectful ; ;<br>
our physical body is much more than just where we live, it's an organism. our organism. and even being ours, we control almost nothing about it, have you ever thought of it ? our body digests food all by itself, our body absorbs the vitamins from sunlight all by itself, our body keeps the temperature stable by all by itself, our body heals bruises all by itself !!! this is so wonderful, our body does everything possible to keep us healthy, not just physically, but emotionally as well. our body even offers endorphins to make us feel rewarded when we have good attitudes and everything ( and these genuinely make us happy ). even if you have a terminal illness, your body will never give up trying to heal you, it will try to keep you as healthy as possible until the last second ! i know it's all instinctive and natural, not really an act of voluntary goodness ; but it's still positive, isn't it ♡ ?<br>
i honestly feel my heart ache when i see people treating their bodies badly... our bodies are so good to us. yes, it fails sometimes, i myself have several skin allergies and for a long time blamed my body for it. my skin is too sensitive and has exaggerated and bad reactions to deal with things it doesn't approve of, but my skin is not conscious. it doesn't know that it's exaggerating, but it still does a great job and keeps me generally very healthy, so it would be unfair not to like it just because it's too sensitive ///<br>
besides our body always doing its best to keep us safe, healthy and satisfied, it is an important part of nature. our body is much larger than we think, there are infinite other tiny living beings that live in our body! our body is not only good for us as it is for other living beings, and it protects all this "small" ecosystem of living things that is harmful and damages our balance.<br>
it is very important that we take care of our physical body in the best possible way : eat properly, use your muscles, get enough sleep, drink water.. whatever you can do, because it is not only a container for your soul, but a part of nature. being organic can have disadvantages, but being part of nature and being such a complex organism is definitely very rewarding and an experience that we should value ♡ !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　☽ ⅱ<br>
i've seen a lot of "self care" content lately, which is pretty good, but some of them are a very confusing or materialistic. i support all sorts of naturally healthy and satisfying tips for our relaxation and well-being ; but some tips are simply toxic, for they force us to do things and be in situations that might do us more harm than good ; ;<br>
i've been feeling kinda sad over the last few days because i've discovered some bad things about people i had not noticed before.. i'm very happy, i'm satisfied with my life, i enjoy every day to the fullest and i try to observe the details and enjoy my time. i have routines and rules to follow that i consider healthy and i feel happy to follow because they bring me good things. i always try to be authentic and sincere, i don't like to pretend or seek approval from other people, i don't do anything that doesn't bring me joy and satisfaction. i give my best to help others in everything i can, and above all, to be happy. and i am happy. i have several life goals, but i'm happy at the moment too, because i live completely and honestly. i believe that i take good care of myself, since i feel happy, right ?<br>
but i realized that people who are following standards for their lives, who are not honest with themselves, who seek happiness just in the future, in objects, in appearance, in relationships... people who are not happy, they can't accept that some people can be happy. truly happy. i realized that some people think i'm "weird" and antisocial, maybe even depressive, because i don't have a very active social life, because i don't maintain relationships with people who are toxic, because i don't force myself to do things that make me sad. i felt sad about it because i realized that it is impossible to "prove" to people that i really am happy and that i could even try to help them to be happier, too. they just don't believe me. they just keep "caring" about me and trying to help me ( ????? )<br>
so after reading about these attitudes i was able to learn something crucial about self care : do nothing that is not comfortable for you.<br>
i know that sometimes we need to make efforts to achieve our goals, but don't push yourself beyond the limit. if something you do is sincerely making you sad and making your life bad, don't do it.<br>
it's hard because people are going to think bad things about you, especially if for being happy you need to isolate yourself a bit socially. i'm a very introverted person so for me it is sincerely very uncomfortable being in some situations, and i don't put myself into them, i refuse. i'm honest and i just hope people will respect me, but people don't respect that kind of choice because they think we have to constantly fight against ourselves to fit patterns and thus be happy.<br>
a good example : your dream of full happiness is to live on a farm completely isolated from society. you accomplish this dream and you are more fully happy than you have ever been before !! people should be happy for you, right ? in fact, they will always tend to feel sorry for you and think that you are isolating yourself, depressingly. this is because they can't imagine themselves in the same situation as you as something good, it's not like they're being purposely inconvenient, they just don't understand. and that's why some self care tips are not always good or work for everyone ; everyone's happiness is found in different ways. we must respect this !<br>
you will never be happy if you force yourself to do things that make you sad, if you keep on seeking incessantly for happiness, molding yourself to be the "rich", "healthy", "successful", "beautiful", "friendly" people think you need to be ; this is not how life works. there's no way you can fit into all these molds, it's an unobtainable ideal. being happy and taking good care of yourself is much simpler than it seems, it just involves being yourself and doing what you love ♡<br>
fill your life with things that make you smile, that make you feel healthy and full. fill your life and your mind with your purity, your essence, you can be happy just being full. that is perfection. there is no better self care than being happy now and with what you have : you will be a much better, secure, kinder, wiser person ; you will be better for yourself and for others !!!<br>
i know it may seem a bit vague, but it's just that : don't take self care tips "for your own good", even if it comes from people you love, if those tips don't make you happy. it's just not good or right.<br>
<br><br>
take care ♡<br>
