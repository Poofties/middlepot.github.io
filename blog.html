the spooky time of the year is here once again, time went by so fast ..
how have you been ? i hope you all are taking care !
for me, it has been a mixture of low energy, mental exhaustion, anxiety and lots of ideas floating around -
basically : every spring i get sick, and this year it wasn't different.. the climate changes + rain season makes me really physically weak, my blood pressure is always low, it's hard to eat, the medicine makes me dizzy ..
not being able to work fully on my projects makes me very anxious, specially now that i'm not getting to make as much money as i need for a living.
i'm doing what i can, trying to take care of myself properly, bubu really helps me <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
doing housework is taking me a lot of energy, but i really want to keep doing my tasks. i know that i'm being slow, please be patient with me .. i promise i'll keep making content and doing my best, i know i will gradually feel better <sub><sub><img width="auto" height="20px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/ge3ODRS.png"/></sub></sub>

these days have been quite interesting, and revealed a bit about myself.. things i haven't thought until now, some reasons behind my recent anxiety
i like calling myself a "timid adventurer", which is certainly a paradox, but well ... i have always been filled with the need of discovering new things - however, i can be extremely methodical and fearful.
thankfully, i always had great passion for small achievements, so just going to the woods to look for insects and wild flowers was enough to feed my sweet tooth for exploration <sub><sub><img width="auto" height="20px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/OQcFLx9.png"/></sub></sub>
because of the pandemic i know that i must not go outside except for the absolute necessary. many people agree that it is okay to leave if it is an isolated place ( which i have always preferred for my activities ) but i haven't been able to feel comfortable due to the current circumstances of the world ...
after losing my mother and seeing many others losing loved ones, i developed a terrible fear of getting sick and seeing other people sick, to the point of preventing me from doing things i loved.
i know it have worsened my anxiety terribly these past times, and i think ( like many other people ) that i will need help and a lot of patience to be able to deal with the outside world after all this is over.. not only does seeing other people make me scared but i have been feeling dirty and contaminated after coming home, even from the grocery store ! i have avoided many situations, and the worst thing is that i know that it is important to fear this disease <sub><sub><img width="auto" height="20px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/p5vHphW.png"/></sub></sub>
despite all this, i have managed to make very happy memories by simply.. playing games !!
playing ragnarok again has been really good for my mental health, even though exploring a virtual world isn't the same, it's certainly making me really happy <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
i had a lot of fun lately, and when i'm feeling weak knowing i can just lay down in bed and play a little bit makes me feel a lot better.
i'm really looking forward to going outside again and living new little adventures in real life, but i really do appreciate the ones i'm having inside home as well <sub><sub><img width="auto" height="20px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/3OAOa4a.png"/></sub></sub>

talking on mmorpg, i started playing tree of savior ! <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
it's a 2016 game that is said to be a "spiritual successor" of ragnarok ( i don't believe so for my experience, they're very different in many ways so i don't think it's fair to keep making comparisons ), and i'm happy that now i can play it properly with my new laptop .. it looks absolutely stunning and it's very complex, with looots of classes and different builds - i'm having a lot of fun trying things out and exploring !!
the maps are all so beautiful i can't stop looking at them <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
sometimes i just stop, sit, and listen to the bgm while looking at the screen. the music is so so good and really helps with the ambiance + simply leveling up is quite relaxing too !
some of the bgm is from soundtemp, same composers from the ragnarok bgm that i love with my whole heart, so i knew it was going to be good.. but seriously, playing the game itself is a complete experience and i have no words to describe.
well, if you haven't seen yet, check my /gaming page because i made very cute little profiles for my characters with lots of info & images <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

so, enough of talking : i made a new web page, mostly for studying css image & text effects, but in the end i liked it so much i might work more on the idea ..
there are just some collages and phrases now, but i could put some more interactive content in the future, probably ?
i really like sites that are just a bunch of random pages that you can explore clicking on things, so i'm thinking of actually putting something after the 4th door !
i'm not sure yet about what i'm going to do with it, so for now let's just appreciate what we already have at <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://world.pooftie.me" target="_blank">world.pooftie.me</a> :

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
there is also this music box melody for the pages !!
i'll surely put more music & sound effects in the next pages, for making it a more interesting experience ~
please let me know what you think !

i also worked on this little project of adapting my social media exclusive content into html pages, in an interesting & responsive way .. since i chose these apps carefully for each kind of content ( and they've been working pretty well for the time being ) it would be a waste if i just had to repost everything manually !
i'm satisfied with the way i post on these apps, even though i don't have much space for customization, i'm using them specifically to let my helpful / comforting stuff reach more people on the internet ; but although most people nowadays are using social media instead of personal websites, i got to know some people who don't have accounts and are not willing to make them, and as much as i understand them perfectly, i want to reach them too !!
so, i got an idea by looking at my tumblr layout : there you can see everything i post & reblog, in a cute web page, and you don't need to have an account for that. the content is placed inside the layout.
sadly, just making iframes for inserting my profiles into some layout isn't an option - for security reasons - so i thought of embeding my posts instead.. and i could do so with my twitter posts pretty easily, customizing everything the way i wanted, but with instagram and youtube things got waaaay harder ; ;
my instagram posts aren't really exclusive because they're just reposts from my /help page, so i'm only interested in making some of my stories out there ( some of them were reposted here on my blog so i don't mind ). my reminders, thoughts, templates & games are really precious and i want to keep them in easy access for everyone !
i decided to actually repost those stories, since there is not a safe way to embed them.. maybe i will find something later.
with youtube i actually can embed my comfort playlist, but customizing the iframe is such a headache and i really don't want to mess with their api right now, as i find it way easier to just make my own html player ( + i could also use with all of my other videos )
so i made a very cute player i can now use for linking my fav yt videos + uploading my poofties videos here !!

i hope you all can make good use of this "self care archive" from now on .. !
i will keep it always updated, as i'll try to return on posting on my accounts at least weekly.

i'm currently working on a new crafting technique and also sewing a little outfit, i believe i will finish everything by next week.. so for the next post you'll get to see them + a new poofties episode !!
i hope you're looking forward to it, see you in two weeks <sub><img width="auto" height="22px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/IdjBPPg.png"/></sub>

this month my website completed 3 years online !!
i'm grateful for everything i learned by sharing my works and thoughts, and specially by your motivating messages. thank you so much <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>

i am slowly adapting into my new, lovely routine ..
doing all housework, taking care of myself & bubu, spending entertaining time, resting properly and still having time for working on projects and eventual commissions... it's certainly a lot to think about !!
but thankfully, i have the time for everything, if i don't spend energy with draining things.
i'm trying my best to keep myself away from all stressful stuff, my plans for are working quite well !
i made a few things lately, but i was feeling the need of resting more than usual.. so i thought it was a good idea to return playing a game that is such a comfort space for me : ragnarok online
i started a whole new account in the official brazilian server, the one i have played since i was 7. i gotta say i am growing pretty fast in there and i'm having a lot of fun exploring the new content, so you might see some updates on my gaming page with my new characters and stuff, once i get to reborn them to transcendent <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>

i'm feeling pretty happy about those experiences, and i'm sure that i will get to make more progress in the projects naturally, if i don't overdo myself.
better spending one month working wholeheartedly than rushing one week wearifully, right ? <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8OvdGqX.gif"/></sub>
i like making posts once i have a handful of things to show, and now it's the right time, so let's see what i made :

this is a little dress up html game i just did for practicing some editing & basic javascript .. what do you think ? <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
i think it turned out very cute, and i'm happy to show you this lovely music box melody too. please click the teddy bear to play it yourself !

after some time without making big ascii art + many requests on the symbols i use, i had the idea of making a web page for keeping my resources, <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://ascii.pooftie.me" target="_blank">ascii.pooftie.me</a> !!
the layout is fully made with symbols ( with a bit of html magic, of course ) <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mKQgU1i.gif"/></sub>
i hope it can be useful for getting started or improving your little "text drawings" :

it's certainly hard making stuff that look interesting with only symbols, it looks simple, but i'm proud <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i often have ideas that sound pretty random, but it's important to try and make things happen, right ?

sometimes i can't get in the mood for working on my most important projects, but i try and make anything for at least make good use of my time by study & practice .. i believe this is a good way of resting while being productive !
i find coloring very relaxing, and as i am feeling a little anxious lately, having cute drawings to color is such a bless <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ldY80KV.gif"/></sub>
so here are two of my most recent ones :

i tried editing the background this time too.. i don't know if i really like it or not, but well. i like the colors & textures.
those adorable coloring pages are from <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://ameblo.jp/jyohanna/" target="_blank">ドリーミィー・フェザー</a> !

long time no see !!
the pandemic has been quite a lot to deal with lately, i am more and more being directly affected by it, it's making me scared and really anxious..
i am trying to care of my mental and physical health as a priority, as i can not fulfill tasks or make good quality content if i'm feeling bad and unmotivated <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MtUpNgx.gif"/></sub>
i'm very thankful for the kind supportive words i receive, it fills me with hope in these dark days <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
my online store is finally getting away from the hiatus, besides the international flights being a mess right now i'm returning to selling and currently keeping the packages for shipping later on ..
now going to the good news,
we're trying our hardest to get over this quarantine and prepare our little home by buying everything we can online, and things are finally getting together now.
contrary to my digital absence, i am working quite a lot in real life with decorating, gardening and many other things house related, so we were able to move there completely and take everything out of the boxes, and that makes me immensely happy <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>

other thing is that i just ordered my wedding dress,, i will only get married next year, but i found my dream dress early and i couldn't help it. my heart just started fluttering when i saw it and i knew it has to be !
i'm trying to save money because we are not getting as much income as the usual, but economy is getting more and more messy every passing day so i thought it would be a good idea to search for the most expensive things right now so we can make sure to have our little wedding in the woods by the date we planned.. !
it will be a small modest wedding around nature and just a few loved ones, so my dress is not very fancy but a "vintage ballerina" inspired one, exactly as i wanted. it's the perfect combination between delicacy & purity <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
a beautiful flower wreath, a daisy bouquet, and my sincere love.. everything arranged into the most beautiful way i could dream of.

in case you're curious, worry not, i made two collages showing a bit of my life plans :</pre>

and this is the matching melody, that sounds quite magical in my opinion.. i have been keeping this one for a long time, waiting for using for something special !
hopefully now i will be able to return to my digital projects and make progress, besides still having lots of housework to do.. there is surely a lot going on lately, right ?
by the way, after a lot of research and saving i finally got to buy a new laptop so now i am super motivated !!
the first thing i did was painting an adorable drawing :</pre><br>

i played around with textures again and i really liked the results .. <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i just showed you fluffies my laptop last post, but now i have a completely new setting, so here we go again :</pre><br><br>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i'm very proud, isn't it super cute ?
believe me or not, it's the first time i am using win10 .. i really like the win7, but it was starting to become a bother at this point ;;

okay, after quite some time without writing q&a texts, i have been questioned about the latest events, naturally.. and i actually have some important things to say, that would add to my "political" background ; so let's go for it !</pre>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br>
<pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">why i won't write about certain political topics ?
i don't like to give opinions on all kind of politics, economics or any subjects that i don't have proper knowledge to write about - however, it doesn't mean to the very least that i am apolitical. i don't believe being apolitical is even possible, just as "doing nothing" isn't possible. by ignoring things you are doing something, and ignoring bad things has a bad impact.. it may be hard to educate yourself, but it's necessary to find your path and not only fluctuate around other people's opinions ! there is no innocence in ignorance, excessive complacency is not a virtue but a harmful political position.
that being said, i do have strong opinions over political topics but i only will write about the subjects that i feel comfortable posting publicly about. what i'm trying to say is that you can help in multiple ways without the need of spreading misinformation, as it does harm too. if i have not studied it properly, if my words wouldn't inspire in any way, if it isn't my place to speak, i won't dare touching it at all ; not because i don't care. on the contrary, i care quite enough for being sensible when standing for talking about important subjects that have impact over others !!
i hope that is well clarified now, seeing that you always demand long answers from me to explain my decisions. knowing that people who follow my content really care about that kind of thing makes me motivated ♡

now, more specifically : why i won't give my opinions on racism ?
that one is a bitter question, saddening even.. how i wish that racism wasn't a topic where we needed to show an "opinion", being such disgusting act of hate. it's nonsense for me and i, thankfully, live around people who think so too. because of that, i know that simply throwing anti-racism words around those already educated people will not help effectively. i must do more.
i do my best to actively help in causes that make a difference, not only with words but with actions. as you know, i do not use names of movements to represent myself, but i do support the relevant actions that these movements may offer, if they match my personal beliefs. the thing is that i, as a white girl, do not feel comfortable getting up to talk about a problem that i can't even imagine what it's like to experience .. this applies not only to racism but other forms of prejudice and oppression, i don't have the right to talk about things that are completely out of my life - however, i can, and will, help with actions that are within my capacity. i will endure and try to help in a relevant way, rather than passively.
you won't see me throwing words of support regarding movements, but if something really important with direct impact is being done, you can be sure that i will be there to help effectively. i deeply believe that instead of trying to prove to the world how good you are, you should be good and do good .. there is no reason to expose these actions, maybe share the idea to reach more people, but not to prove your worth.
i believe that movements can have their relevance in spreading helpful actions, but they definitely take away a lot of individuality as they are more "practical" to share. just press a button and that's it, you did your part... but did you really ?
when sharing content you need to have in mind that you are reaching people that follow you, therefore, that are similar to you. they will agree with the good causes you are sharing, but only agreeing isn't enough : it will give you reputation points, but nothing will change. searching for content that will lead these people to an oportunity in helping actively for the cause, within their reality, is the best you can do !!
i try to form my own opinion and spread the good with my words, with my content and my actions, and for that, i do not act on impulse to participate in anything ; i evaluate the causes and actions before i get up and take a step forward. there are people who are really struggling to make something relevant happen, and i appreciate it immensely.. i look forward supporting these people. if they happen to use movement names i don't mind ( unless the movement itself is rather problematic ), but working hard for a good cause is completely different to relying entirely on "ready to use" sentences. as a white person i would feel completely pathetic in using racism, something terrible i will never experience, as a way to gain compliments and followers. i will never do so, and i will never support people who do so. i share helpful content, i create hopefully helpful content, and it's okay if some people are going to misinterpret me because i don't do those things in search of praise.
help black people, be gentle with black people, respect black people, support the value and importance that each individual has in society. do it not only when a movement is trending, do it not only by sharing repetitive phrases, but on a daily basis, because you can. do it through kindness and love out of pure will, not to improve your reputation !

that's it for today !! keep an eye open and you will see new content soon ~
