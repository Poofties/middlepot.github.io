hiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/57rSlgO.gif"/><br>
i feel absolutely soft these days ~<br>
i have learned a lot about patience and self control, but mostly about self care !<br>
i'm pretty anxious when it comes to being productive, i'd say i'm almost addicted to that sense of accomplishment after having a busy day.<br>
the problem is that i always felt useless when i was in my spare time ; ;<br>
this is not healthy, so i'm trying my best to respect the free hours of my day as much as the working hours, after all, both are important <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ayl9a7S.gif"/><br>
i'm also feeling that i'm getting more and more free of the "physical" things... even though they really matter to me, i know that too much bonding to them emotionally makes me feel needy easily, which is not good at all !<br>
it is definitely essential to remember that the most important things are not physical, because naturally, what makes us feel like home is where our heart is, not our body <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YYQfh8r.gif"/><br>
<br>
aaa i would like to comment on this super cute app that i'm really enjoying, custom cast ♡ !!<br>
it's the best 3D character customization app i've ever used !<br>
i'm really enjoying this vtuber thing lately, it's really cute and a lot of new fun possibilities are popping up.<br>
do you like vtubers too ? i love them ♡ !!!<br>
i made myself in this app :<br>

<br>
today, double q&a !<br>
first subject is about trauma coping issues, second one about virtual world issues.<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ణ ⅰ<br>
this subject is very specific but i feel i should express myself about it, since i see many people with weird and even disgusting kinks, aesthetics or artistic expressions, justifying it as a way of "coping trauma". i don't particularly think it's completely wrong, but very controversial and dangerous.<br>
i follow some trauma blogs and i see many toxic people in this environment, as well as people who are harmed or treated bad for posting controversial stuff.<br>
any kind of trauma or sensitivity to some bad, disgusting, dangerous, ugly subjects in general can become an obstacle in people's lives. no one wants to feel dirty or bad. it is natural trying to deal with such experiences or thoughts ; trying to romanticize, normalize, or even sexualizate. we want to see beauty and pleasure in ugly things so we don't feel rejection for them and for ourselves and our bad memories, but obviously we need to take responsibility for this type of action and specify the motives, inform people of the problems and risks and not treat as something cute and casual. it's not the kind of content you have the right to post anywhere or spread around the world, no matter how traumatized you are. you have NO RIGHT to bother other people with your confused and romanticized content.<br>
people usually deal with this sort of thing in the form of art, aesthetics and even kinks, there are people who do ugly romanticized things to become their aesthetic and way of life as a way of coping with trauma. this is something natural and there is usually no intention to hurt someone, just to make things simpler ; the problem is that this kind of attitude should not be treated as something simple. people who do this kind of art, people who post on this kind of aesthetics, people who live such lives should not spread to the world what they do as if it were something beautiful and desirable. this type of content, which has "damaged innocence", are something very sensitive, that i support, because they have already helped me a lot, but within specific communities and treated properly, as something very delicate and dangerous.<br>
if you're not aware of what you're doing you can put yourself in danger situations intentionally to try to confront your fears and this is not at all healthy or acceptable, depending on your condition. this is one side where self diagnosis can be dangerous because you really can't handle extreme things in an extreme way without having proper help, but i've already written about that subject. i've also commented about how kinks being treated as a cute and cool "aesthetic" and spread over the internet is a bad thing for influencing young people and being harmful to other people.<br>
when i say that these processes of romanticizing helped me, it is true, it helped me a lot at a time that i was feeling very insecure and dirty because of my sometimes weird, dangerous and controversial desires. i was embarrassed to talk to anyone about it and this kind of romanticized content helped me a lot to understand that i was not a bad person by feeling what i felt, but more importantly, i was educated to know that even though it was "normal" it was not necessarily a right thing to do, or something to be proud of. so it has always been a secret and helped me to mature. over time, i could better understand what i felt and separate harmful things from healthy ones, and so be able to have a better lifestyle ( please don't ask me details about it, it makes me very uncomfortable /// ). it would be extremely hypocritical if i said that romanticizing is always bad, i just think that caution and instructions for such content are fundamental, to prevent this from being a bad influence and worsen people's mental health.<br>
i don't think people really need to have gone through physical traumas to have the "right to coping", that's a very disrespectful opinion ; everyone has the right to overcome their fears and problems, the problem is that when you do it publicly and treat it as something soft and romantic, such as a "broken doll" or "fallen angel", other people are harmed because they will put themselves in danger intentionally and consequently end up traumatized as well.<br>
finally, again, i confirm that i don't think it's wrong to romanticize things or even sexualize them if it makes you feel better, but it is something extremely personal and delicate that must be done with caution and with the notion that suffering is not nice. it may be poetically beautiful, interesting, but it's not something that anyone should desire as it's dangerous and harmful.<br>
and anyway, i think it's good to consult professional help to know if you are coping in a healthy way because each person has particularities when dealing with this type of thing ! please stay safe ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　ణ ⅱ<br>
as you know, i am very involved with the "virtual world". the internet is part of my life and many of my works are digital. even so, i highly value the caution in creating a "virtual identity" just as i think it's sorely primordial to avoid spending too much time on the internet and overvalue the virtual world.<br>
i learned over time that the virtual world may seem "perfect" and incredible, just as it very easily occupies our time ( often not free time ) and entertains us ; but it's also very limited, so it is not worth replacing your "real life" time.<br>
the internet can be very useful for learning new things, interacting with people from all over the world, personal improving, and even for sorts of important jobs and hobbies, which is why i love the internet and value it. but the internet can only stimulate our sight and hearing, and we have five senses. only real life can stimulate all five senses and bring us full life experiences full of sensations and feelings !!<br>
you can't eat freshly picked wild berries, you can't feel the scent of flowers, you can't pet a fluffy animal, you can't hug people you love over the internet. don't substitute your real time for the virtual, it's not worth it. the internet has many limitations, it is inferior in comparison.<br>
and just as all experiences are much more intense and wonderful in real life, you too can only be as perfect and better as possible in real life. the virtual identity that we create exists to allow us to introduce others who are far from us, we can put together the best visuals we can offer and we can also publish works and receive reviews and feedback, we can learn and improve ; but you really are much more special with all the details. your image and voice are not all you have to offer, you in real life are a complete person and if you focus on improving yourself as a whole and not only superficially, you can enjoy the virtual world and the world real in the best way possible : beneficial, fun and above all, healthy ♡ !<br>

these are subjects that i always see people having confused feelings about, and that also confused me a lot for several years ; ;<br>
it's the kind of thing that gets in the way of our personal development, so i really hope that my texts are useful to you in some way ///<br>

i have great news for you : i decided that i will learn how to sew clothes, like my mom !!<br>
yes, i really want to improve my seamstress skills now.<br>
i decided this when thinking about the topic of fashion and how i love designing my own clothes.. and i don't really know how to sew clothes.<br>
i don't want to depend on my mom forever to sew my clothes and put ideas into practice, so i've decided that i will learn seriously !<br>
i'll start with simple clothes for myself, but as soon as i become more confident i plan to sew things to my store as well <img src="https://i.imgur.com/86tN3lf.gif"/><br>
yes, you will see exclusive clothes and bags at the shy bunny store in the near future ♡ !!!<br>
i'm really excited for this, i know it will be a big improvement for me <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uqX9qnQ.gif"/><br>
my mom is encouraging me a lot and will teach me all the techniques !<br>
it's time to overcome the apprehension with sewing machines... wish me luck ♡<br>
<br>
well, i'd like to make a little break in this post for kefir appreciation !!!<br>
( i don't know how to call them, but i mean the living things that make natural yogurt )<br>
i've been creating kefir for a few months now, and i like them so much <img src="https://i.imgur.com/y5Kfd1j.gif"/><br>
they are like fluffy clouds, and although they consume lots of milk, they always provide me yummy high quality yogurt for me to drink every morning ♡<br>
if you have the opportunity to create a cute cloud colony too, i really recommend.<br>
<br>
so, after that random break.. i have here a colorful, nostalgic and super cute collage !!<br>

<br>
nooow, of course, double q&a !<br>
i wrote very positive and motivating texts this time, the first one is about a positive world view, the second one is about self care.<br>
i wonder if these motivational texts actually help in any way and are not just "temporary positive energy"<br>
i struggle to follow my own advice, if you want to know... it's easy to cry a lot and get mad at everything and everyone <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KWSo2mh.gif"/><br>
but the important thing is to take a deep breath and think before you act not to hurt yourself or other people !<br>
things will not be always easy or positive, right ?<br>

　☾ ⅰ<br>
i want to urgently vent on this, it's so tiring to see people being bitter and negative, i just wanted to say : the world is not ugly.<br>
the world is not a bad place, people are not horrible, life is not sad and tragic, no no no !!!<br>
to begin with, the world is simply neutral. nature works in an extremely balanced way, everything is always in its proper place + bad and good things are equally necessary for everything to work well. it's impossible for a world to be good if only good things exist, i know it's confusing, but good and evil only exist if both exist. and this is something positive !<br>
good experiences are better after bad moments of perseverance to achieve them. dreams are only dreams because they can't be realized right away. the fact that there are bad things and difficulties should be something that motivates you and makes the world interesting and beautiful, not the other way around ; ;<br>
moreover, beauty is something very abstract in general. the world is not really ugly or beautiful, it's neutral because beauty depends on the eyes of the beholder. for example, you may very much like to eat a dish that looks disgusting but has a divine flavor. the "beauty" as we know is something visual, not that it's wrong, since i myself am an extremely visual person and always use this love for beauty to find out more about myself and the world, beautiful things make me feel happy and motivated, i love beauty ; but this is not so important in the world in general.<br>
our sight is something sensitive and if you miss it, it's not as if all the beauty is gone. even if beauty is mostly visual, there is a lot more involved in this concept than we should consider as well. good things are always present in our lives : smells, tastes, sounds, textures... all this is as important as the visual. the beauty is in all this, so it is impossible not to have beauty in all things, no matter how "ugly" it may seem.<br>
the world, life, nature, being perfectly neutral, allow us to take our paths and interpret things as we wish. i consider it healthy enough to be positive and see the usefulness and necessity of bad things as a motivational and educational way, and see good things as blessings to be enjoyed to the fullest, cherished and treasured as nostalgias. i consider the world a perfectly beautiful place because i want to be happy. like, why would i see the bad side of everything on purpose ? this doesn't make sense to me.<br>
my desire is to mature enough to be happy and find beauty and importance in all sorts of things. it's not just a romanticization, it's a way of being able to enjoy life in a healthy and light way, to stay bright and pure no matter what bad experiences you have experienced.<br>
the world is neutral but i consider it the most beautiful thing possible because it is purely perfect exactly as it is. ♡<br>
<br>
to complete this subject, i think people are also very negative when they talk about their bodies... and i'm not even talking about visual insecurities about it, but people really underestimate their bodies. our physical body is not just a bunch of flesh and by chance we're stuck inside it, it makes me sad when people talk like that, it's so disrespectful ; ;<br>
our physical body is much more than just where we live, it's an organism. our organism. and even being ours, we control almost nothing about it, have you ever thought of it ? our body digests food all by itself, our body absorbs the vitamins from sunlight all by itself, our body keeps the temperature stable by all by itself, our body heals bruises all by itself !!! this is so wonderful, our body does everything possible to keep us healthy, not just physically, but emotionally as well. our body even offers endorphins to make us feel rewarded when we have good attitudes and everything ( and these genuinely make us happy ). even if you have a terminal illness, your body will never give up trying to heal you, it will try to keep you as healthy as possible until the last second ! i know it's all instinctive and natural, not really an act of voluntary goodness ; but it's still positive, isn't it ♡ ?<br>
i honestly feel my heart ache when i see people treating their bodies badly... our bodies are so good to us. yes, it fails sometimes, i myself have several skin allergies and for a long time blamed my body for it. my skin is too sensitive and has exaggerated and bad reactions to deal with things it doesn't approve of, but my skin is not conscious. it doesn't know that it's exaggerating, but it still does a great job and keeps me generally very healthy, so it would be unfair not to like it just because it's too sensitive ///<br>
besides our body always doing its best to keep us safe, healthy and satisfied, it is an important part of nature. our body is much larger than we think, there are infinite other tiny living beings that live in our body! our body is not only good for us as it is for other living beings, and it protects all this "small" ecosystem of living things that is harmful and damages our balance.<br>
it is very important that we take care of our physical body in the best possible way : eat properly, use your muscles, get enough sleep, drink water.. whatever you can do, because it is not only a container for your soul, but a part of nature. being organic can have disadvantages, but being part of nature and being such a complex organism is definitely very rewarding and an experience that we should value ♡ !!!<br>
<br>

　☽ ⅱ<br>
i've seen a lot of "self care" content lately, which is pretty good, but some of them are a very confusing or materialistic. i support all sorts of naturally healthy and satisfying tips for our relaxation and well-being ; but some tips are simply toxic, for they force us to do things and be in situations that might do us more harm than good ; ;<br>
i've been feeling kinda sad over the last few days because i've discovered some bad things about people i had not noticed before.. i'm very happy, i'm satisfied with my life, i enjoy every day to the fullest and i try to observe the details and enjoy my time. i have routines and rules to follow that i consider healthy and i feel happy to follow because they bring me good things. i always try to be authentic and sincere, i don't like to pretend or seek approval from other people, i don't do anything that doesn't bring me joy and satisfaction. i give my best to help others in everything i can, and above all, to be happy. and i am happy. i have several life goals, but i'm happy at the moment too, because i live completely and honestly. i believe that i take good care of myself, since i feel happy, right ?<br>
but i realized that people who are following standards for their lives, who are not honest with themselves, who seek happiness just in the future, in objects, in appearance, in relationships... people who are not happy, they can't accept that some people can be happy. truly happy. i realized that some people think i'm "weird" and antisocial, maybe even depressive, because i don't have a very active social life, because i don't maintain relationships with people who are toxic, because i don't force myself to do things that make me sad. i felt sad about it because i realized that it is impossible to "prove" to people that i really am happy and that i could even try to help them to be happier, too. they just don't believe me. they just keep "caring" about me and trying to help me ( ????? )<br>
so after reading about these attitudes i was able to learn something crucial about self care : do nothing that is not comfortable for you.<br>
i know that sometimes we need to make efforts to achieve our goals, but don't push yourself beyond the limit. if something you do is sincerely making you sad and making your life bad, don't do it.<br>
it's hard because people are going to think bad things about you, especially if for being happy you need to isolate yourself a bit socially. i'm a very introverted person so for me it is sincerely very uncomfortable being in some situations, and i don't put myself into them, i refuse. i'm honest and i just hope people will respect me, but people don't respect that kind of choice because they think we have to constantly fight against ourselves to fit patterns and thus be happy.<br>
a good example : your dream of full happiness is to live on a farm completely isolated from society. you accomplish this dream and you are more fully happy than you have ever been before !! people should be happy for you, right ? in fact, they will always tend to feel sorry for you and think that you are isolating yourself, depressingly. this is because they can't imagine themselves in the same situation as you as something good, it's not like they're being purposely inconvenient, they just don't understand. and that's why some self care tips are not always good or work for everyone ; everyone's happiness is found in different ways. we must respect this !<br>
you will never be happy if you force yourself to do things that make you sad, if you keep on seeking incessantly for happiness, molding yourself to be the "rich", "healthy", "successful", "beautiful", "friendly" people think you need to be ; this is not how life works. there's no way you can fit into all these molds, it's an unobtainable ideal. being happy and taking good care of yourself is much simpler than it seems, it just involves being yourself and doing what you love ♡<br>
fill your life with things that make you smile, that make you feel healthy and full. fill your life and your mind with your purity, your essence, you can be happy just being full. that is perfection. there is no better self care than being happy now and with what you have : you will be a much better, secure, kinder, wiser person ; you will be better for yourself and for others !!!<br>
i know it may seem a bit vague, but it's just that : don't take self care tips "for your own good", even if it comes from people you love, if those tips don't make you happy. it's just not good or right.<br>
<br><br>
take care ♡<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ShvX4UB.gif"/><br>
yes, so many posts in a short time <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bMjk3ob.gif"/><br>
this is because i have a lot of content to post here, and more and more... so i have planned several posts yet for this year !<br>
i have learned a lot about plants, it has become a great interest <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iyUbUmA.gif"/><br>
i've always been very interested in animals, but i think plants are also great, i just.. really like to take care of other living things, in general.<br>
i feel really good helping who i can, i want to take care of many plants and animals, the best as i can <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MLt1jzy.gif"/><br>
<br>
i have organized many things here these days, old things.<br>
this has left me pretty nostalgic, so i decided to start some projects to "eternalize" my memories !<br>
i have several letter paper and notebook pages that i kind of collected when i was in school, so i decided to cover a box with my favorite papers and use it to keep my journals. i've had diaries since i was 8, so they're very precious to me ♡<br>
the box got a 2000s aesthetic with many different shades of pink and glitter.. which is nostalgically perfect, even if not very aesthetically neat, you know ?<br>
thinking about it, i remembered the digital stuff that i did at the time, that follow this same idea ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iEWWJy6.gif"/><br>
i have here folders with very old things, from when i started to use the internet, including several .txt files with posts that i posted on my old blog, all the images i used ( i always kept everything for security )<br>
and, i also have all the layouts i've done + the codes !!<br>
the only sad thing is that my old blog is not on the web.archive ( just a few specific things, but it's a mess )<br>
so i always looked at the posts in txt and the images... and it was not quite the same thing ; ;<br>
i would really like to eternalize my first layout, with everything in place !<br>
so i recreated my first layout ever, from 2006, with the codes and images and texts i had saved, with the post from when i started using this new layout, and it's all exactly as it was before ♡ !!!<br>
i used a cute weeaboo domain ( kawaii.info.gf ), because it really fits the whole thing ~<br>
i had to re-create some scripts that were for the old internet explorer, so it didn't work anymore.<br>
i used to embed youtube videos on the blog for music, so that's what i did. i didn't have the exact music i was using at the time, but i remember it was from di gi charat, so that's what i put there !<br>
i liked to use english words sometimes, but i didn't really know any english at the time. should be the reason why i put my personal info in the "things" column instead of the "me" one LOL<br>
if you know portuguese, you should be surprised with my correct grammar ( since i was 8 ), and it's true, i had the help of my mom to write everything right on my blog !<br>
of course my mom always knew what i posted on my blog, so she helped me a lot. it was a very important time for me, i was learning many new things and i read and write a lot ♡ !<br>
i think the internet can be very productive for children, if they use it in a healthy way.<br>
i have many good memories of my old blog, i'm very happy that now it really is properly eternalized, including in web.archive ( as well as all my precious things )<br>
i'll leave a backup here as well :<br>

　❀ ⅰ<br>
people who have an interest in web design often have doubts about how i made this site and all my html stuff. as you all know, i've made things in html for many years, and i make lots of original and random things all the time. html and css is really something i love ♡ !<br>
i made this site, just like all my stuff in html, from scratch. i write everything in notepad and test in .html files, or in <a text-decoration: none; href="https://milk.honey.my" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">my html tester</font></a>. i know there are several platforms nowadays that make things a lot easier, but i always did everything from scratch because it was how i decided to start with html, from the beginning i always thought : if i had total freedom with the codes and to put everything exactly where i want and as i wish ; it was perfect. it was what i wanted. dealing with platforms for web design has always irritated me a little, honestly ; ;<br>
so, i don't have platforms to recommend, besides tumblr, because i use it and never had problems. but still, dealing with pure html is my preferred way of doing things. if you are going to make a website that is a blog or something, which will always need to be updated, using a platform would be really simpler to begin with ; but i recommend training html the old way because it helps a lot in learning ! if you really want to do things beautifully and freely, you have to lose the fear of dealing with pure codes.<br>
web design obviously has a lot of aesthetic sense, but i've talked about aesthetics many times around here so i think this part is unnecessary... but still about visual, i really recommend you have folders of materials and graphics that can be useful. i have had several folders of materials since i was a kid, and i got all that content basically exploring the internet. blogs and websites of cute stuff are a bit rare nowadays, but on tumblr i always find it with a little effort !! the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://web.archive.org" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">web.archive</font></a> is also wonderful to find interesting sites. i have here on the site the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://middlepot.com/recommended" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">recommended page</font></a> where i have some sites & blog that can be useful for this, and i also have a <a text-decoration: none; href="https://potix-u.my.to" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">pixel blog</font></a>, where i have several things that i use ( the blogs that i reblog from are also good places ).<br>
now that you have several materials to do beautiful things, you need to deal with the code itself. i find html very easy, i learned to deal with it at 8, simply with small tutorials and mainly browsing other people's blogs. i know it may seem controversial but when it comes to html there is a lot that you can ( and should ) take reference to other people's codes because these are things that everyone can use and are not owned by someone specific. i honestly recommend that you always look at the source code of all the sites you are interested in understanding how they were made. after a little study you will understand how things work and will learn mostly from this practice. make sure you have a folder for codes ( you can just save it in txt files ) because you will always find things that are interesting and that you may want to use in the future ! when it comes to css and javascript ( style and script ) you can find some code that is original and can not be copied, but in this case you will certainly see a warning text. if you see no warning, you are free to try to use !<br>
to practice, i recommend doing small projects like some pictures and texts on the screen, cute little random things that you have in mind... just let the imagination flow, think of things you'd like to do with the codes you've saved. if you really want to do layouts for a website or blog, i recommend starting with a base code. it's very bad copying the whole source code from someone's site to use as a base, but many people provide very useful base codes for you to have room for all things, it makes things very easy ! you just have to decide what you want to do exactly and look for codes for that sort of thing. you can find whole codes that are visually neutral for you to modify, or you can find only parts of what you want. you can put it all together smoothly. if you are using specific platforms, you will need base code to do what you want functionally within the platform, since these have rules of use and operation.<br>
it's a lot of fun to add signatures and some codes that you specifically like in your base codes. seeing ideas being born is sure to be the biggest motivation for you, so please don't give up before you try !!!<br>
i have a base code myself, i always use some similar css and i have a pretty cute ascii art signature at the beginning and end of all html pages. in fact, to be clear, <b>i allow</b> you to always look at the source code of this site and my stuff if you need inspiration or understand how i did things in it. you can use all the scripts and css, too. just don't copy everything ( especially visually ), of course, be original !<br>
in the beginning, you may feel a little bit of tension in messing with the base code and ruining everything, but over time you will feel more comfortable. i took a lot of time to do things freely, remembering that i did my first layout at the age of 8, so although i managed to do pretty good things, i obviously had a long time to get to where i am today ///<br>
it's normal that you don't understand anything that's going on for a long time, but don't worry about it, because the important thing is that things are working. you will understand how everything works with practice. now, when it comes to javascript, the thing really complicates. is much more "programming" than html and css, so you'll have to study harder if you want to make interesting scripts by yourself ; but you don't have to worry about it if programming is not your interest because you can find the scripts you need to do all sorts of things if you search right. it is still possible to make great things only with your interest in the visual side of web design ♡ !<br>
good, now that you already have your inspirations, your materials & graphics folder, your useful codes folder, your base codes.. where to post your projects and studies ?<br>
there are several sites where you can post things in html, but i use and recommend github. in it you can make a repository for every project you have and put the .html files there, you can change the domain and everything. about domains, github has its own domain for pages, but there are other sites where you can get cute and exclusive domains for you ! the site i use to get all my html stuff domains is <a text-decoration: none; href="https://freedns.afraid.org" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">freedns</font></a> ( just be careful to choose only public domains ). by the way, you can also use those cute domains on tumblr.<br>
to get ssl on your html pages, remember that all the links you have in your code must be "https", including images and scripts. thus, you will be able to get ssl easily on any platform you are using ! finding good websites ( with ssl ) to host your stuff to use in your codes can be difficult and time-consuming, but i have on the <a text-decoration: none; href="https://middlepot.com/credits" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">credits page</font></a> all the sites i use to host each file type ! i recommend each of them, until the present moment.<br>
<br>
i think that's all !! everything that i indicated here are things that i legitimately do and that work for me.<br>
i hope from the bottom of my heart that i can help and inspire you ♡ !!!<br>
please feel free to ask me something else that i may have forgotten to explain here ( which is not too specific, because this text is more general as a guide for beginners )<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　❀ ⅱ<br>
before talking about beauty care, i would like to write a little more about my fashion style. i've already written about the styles that inspire me and that i'm interested in, but i didn't specified about my aesthetic inspirations for clothes and accessories !<br>
as you may already know by now, most of my things are handmade. i make practically all my accessories and my clothes are also customized by me or designed by me and made by my mom, who is a seamstress. practically everything i use is handmade, including handbags ( which are usually in the form of stuffed animals, because i think it's lovely ♡ ). i just don't work with shoes and hats, unfortunately ; ;<br>
for that reason i felt it would be great to have a store where i could sell things that i do, and i want to increase the variety of items more and more, as well as reach more people selling overseas !!<br>
but the point is : why do i make almost everything i use ?<br>
well, it started because i had a lot of interest in japanese brands and importing it was expensive and it was not a very viable option, so i started to have an interest in customization and crafting, something i had before but not with fashion. my mom has been a seamstress for a long time, but i didn't have much fashion sense for designing my clothes, choosing the right fabrics and everything. it was a matter of time before i was completely into these things ♡ !<br>
what most inspires my fashion style is obviously my main aesthetic, which involves comfort, nostalgia, femininity and delicacy ; these are the qualities that i always look for in my clothes and accessories.<br>
you know that i really value purity, and i believe wearing clothes that represent our personality and feelings is important for it. i feel extremely happy and comfortable to see that my appearance corresponds with who i am. i always look for fabrics that are soft and delicate, feminine accessories, delicate lace and ribbons, cute little animals on everything !! soft colors and a little "faded" tones are my favorite because they refer me to old stuffies, those that are super special, that you love so much and have great memories about.. i love cute & cozy motifs in general, but i also like motifs that match the weather because they usually help me feel refreshed when it's hot outside, and warm when it's cold.<br>
i believe the secret to finding the perfect style for you is just to find your favorite aesthetics and what best represents your personality ! the essential thing here is to respect your comfort and to have self knowledge. i would say that the more you have sharp eyes to find potential beauty in things, the simpler it becomes to have a style that perfectly represents you, so it's really a matter of practice. i super recommend to practice saving beautiful images that inspire you and making collages with them, it's a lot of fun ♡ !!<br>
the places that most inspire me for fashion are aesthetics blogs on tumblr, collage videos ( i have many in <a text-decoration: none; href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsBmCEP2InOp69wlTeQKg7GnB2EG5apxD" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">my asmr playlist</font></a>, which by the way is very visually consistent ), and i always used polyvore for the look ideas, but since it no longer exists, i just make the collages in photoshop. i fortunately always saved the pictures of the items, so i have many in a folder here ( if i find good alternatives to polyvore i promise i'll let you know ). if you like dress up games, i would say they are also very good inspirations : my first one was <i>poupée girl</i> ( which no longer exists, but i have lots of images on the gaming page ), but <i>cocoppa play</i> is also really good and is still active !<br>
of course you can vary your style within your aesthetics whenever you want, and it's something i've been trying a lot recently, but it just depends on how comfortable you feel at the moment with those clothes. according to the day, the weather and the situation, you can suddenly feel in a mood to try a very different style !!<br>
<br>
<br>
so, to begin with the beauty care texts, i would like to say that beauty is directly linked to good things about people. a kind person is certainly very beautiful, and i've talked about it before... but in a more visual way, i believe that the healthier and natural you look, the more beautiful, visually. if you keep artificial and unhealthy, it will be hard to feel comfortable in your body, and that is an important attribute for beauty. people who are just running away from their natural beauty have hard times with self-esteem, and that's sad.<br>
i would like to help, so i'll give you beauty tips on what i value : health and comfort !<br>
<br>
　　♡　skin care :<br>
i have very sensitive skin, i have allergies frequently. this condition always makes me worry about the products i use. i always use natural products or baby products, these don't give me allergy and luckily are also great, i don't think i should be using any other type of product !<br>
i think it is essential to keep the skin clean, hydrated and free of harsh chemicals. i always wash the skin with natural ( or baby ) soaps, which are very soft and don't take too much natural oil from the skin. my skin is not very oily so i worry about keeping the natural oils and using them to my advantage. i've never had problems with acne or blackheads, but i've always had whiteheads, what have helped me more than anything about them and also keeps my skin completely clean of any pollution are two things : honey and rose milk !<br>
honey is truly amazing, the skin becomes incredibly soft, clean, with an incredible natural glow and it also helps a lot in recovering from any damage, since it has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. i use honey on my skin frequently, i also use it + sugar to exfoliate from time to time. i always use in bruises and when my skin is having allergic reactions to avoid bigger problems and help in healthy recovery.<br>
rose milk is basically rose water + baking soda and some other things, which make the rose water become milky in texture and color. this mixture cleans a lot from any pollution, it's amazing and i use it whenever i feel i need.<br>
to moisturize i always use natural oils or baby oil. i always apply by massaging on the whole body, especially in areas with more fat, because this helps blood circulation and the skin gets more elasticity ( massaging the face is also very important ). my favorite oils are coconut oil and almond oil ! i think the combination of the two smells like honey, but everyone says it smells like vanilla. i love vanilla and honey, so i'm happy anyway ♡<br>
despite my skin care routine ( with cleansing, exfoliation & hydration ) is only once a day, it's important to keep the skin clean and moisturized all day. during the winter my skin gets very dry, so i'm always moisturizing it, multiple times a day. during the summer my skin easily looks greasy, especially if i'm outside, so i always clean my face and hands with baby wipes ( washing only with fresh water is most appropriate but not always possible ) and use moisturizer. keeping the skin fresh is very important to avoid pollution and premature aging !<br>
i can also recommend you to always wash your face with cold water ( your pores NEVER should be left open ), wear sunscreen every day, i recommend the most natural ones with coconut oil ( the sun is important and it is good to sunbathe in the morning, but the afternoon sun can be terribly bad for your skin + NEVER pose your face towards the sun ) and of course : drink lots of water ( two liters a day is the minimum ), this is really important !!<br>
<br>
　　♡　hair care :<br>
because of the sensitivity of my skin, i also use natural products or baby products in my hair, of course. since my hair is completely natural i don't need to worry so much about it, i use few products. my hair is very wavy and long. it is also not too oily just like my skin, so i also like to take advantage of the natural oils. i usually wash it three times a week in hot weather and twice in cold weather, i only use water and baby shampoo normally. no conditioner. why did i mention the water ? because it is very important, even if you have not thought about it, it's part of the cleaning process as well. i always wash my hair with plenty of water and rub well the root to spread the natural oils to the tips, only after i use a little shampoo to clean the excess oil, sweat and pollution. i feel that this process makes my hair much lighter and it gets very clean, soft and hydrated ! for extra hydration i always use natural oils, the same ones i use for the skin. washing with cold water is very important to prevent oiliness in the hair, i also always use cold dryer. always dry the root very well !<br>
another thing that i think is very important is combing your hair with a wide wooden comb ( or a similar brush ). these combs keeps the hair very soft and hydrated up to the tips, plus they don't cause hair loss or frizz. to keep your hair always looking soft and moisturized from the root to the tips it's very important to brush your hair multiple times a day, especially if you are out there because the pollution gives it a greasy look that is not healthy.<br>
<br>
　　♡　makeup :<br>
um i almost don't wear makeup, so i surely don't have much experience to talk about it. i don't like to wear makeup because i feel my skin very weird.. i only use it on special occasions, even though it is always very light. i think wearing just a little makeup helps my skin stay healthy, anyway. it doesn't like many products.<br>
i don't like wearing base or concealer, i just have bb cream in case there is something wrong that i want to cover.. usually there is nothing, i don't have so dark circles, i'm used to it, so i just let it be.<br>
in my eyes my biggest problem is my eyelashes, you must have realized that they are very straight. i don't like that, so it's common for me to use eyelash curler and transparent mascara, just to keep them in place. i have brown eye pencils and eyeshadow for sometimes delineating, i like to keep it as natural as possible.<br>
i don't do anything with my eyebrows, i don't really bother with them all natural.<br>
i don't like bronzer, but i really like blush, i like it a lot. i also like highlighter, but i use it wisely ( i try ). i always get inspired in igari makeup and i struggle not to use too much blush and look like sunburned ; ;<br>
on my lips i always moisturize constantly with natural oils ( my lips get dry often i hate it ), but i am truly an eternal lover of lip gloss and lip balm. i don't like lipsticks, though. i like to have my lips super moisturized and shiny, but not colored.<br>
umm and sometimes i add a little tiny bit of white glitter on my cheeks, lips or eyelids ! i think it's very cute.<br>
<br>
　　♡　nails :<br>
i'm also not experienced with nail art, but i'll talk about my nails anyway. i think there are not many secrets to getting your nails healthy, i think proper nutrition and hydration are the most important thing. my nails grow very fast, just like my hair, i can't really tell the reasons because it was always like this.. but i can say i always keep them super moisturized with natural oils ( the same ones i use for the skin ), i moisturize them multiple times a day, whenever i wash my hands. it's very important to always keep your nails clean and moisturized, so i never forget the baby wipes and the moisturizer when i'm outside !<br>
i always cut the cuticles ( not too much, just the excess ) and keep them clean. i used to paint my nails often and did nail art on them, but i stopped doing it because i just don't feel interested anymore. people always say that keeping nails painted is important to keep them strong but i can confirm that this is a myth, at least partially. when i always painted my nails and one day i didn't they were really weak, it's true ; but this is because they were already damaged by the use of nail polish. when i stopped using nail polish frequently, after a few months they became stronger, beautiful and healthier than ever before ! in this case, it depends on whether you want to use polish frequently or not.<br>
i usually keep my nails very short and oval shape, but when i'm in the mood i let them a little longer and almond shape.<br>
<br>
　　♡ tl ; dr :<br>
if you always stay clean, moisturized and hydrated you will always be healthy and flawless from the beginning until the end of the day, which will definitely make your life a lot better !!<br>
<br><br>
i'm very sincere in these texts, really based on personal experiences.<br>
i always try my best to be clear and useful to you, so please tell me your opinions ///<br>
