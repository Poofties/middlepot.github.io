hiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WBtDHoi.gif"/><br>
so many things have happened in last weeks .. i'm a little overwhelmed, even ; ;<br>
but i'm trying my best to rest and respect my relaxing time !!<br>
it's always hard keeping a routine and schedules, since my body and my mind not always agree with what i'm supposed to do.. but this is also part of a healthy routine !<br>
sometimes we need to adapt the schedule to respect our time and not get too tired.<br>
it's actually common for me to have a full lazy day and the next day i feel super motivated to do all tasks for three days.. !<br>
the important thing is to not pressure myself to follow the routine 100%, since it's supposed to be helpful and not a bother. if i'm doing my weekly tasks and resting properly, everything is ok !!<br>
<br>
so .. you may have noticed some very "drastic" changes in all my social media,,<br>
i was already making a sort of cleaning, but this time.. i just couldn't keep doing it.<br>
i decided to finally stop this pain and actually delete my accounts and make new ones !<br>
i have now new accounts for my "not bad" project ; my social media accs <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PCwccpM.gif"/><br>
i mean, only my tumblr blogs are the same, but i changed urls : now it's @pufti and @pofti, which is really cute and match ( for real now )<br>
as you already know, i don't use social media for personal content but to post actual helpful stuff.. maybe not thaaat helpful but i always try to post things that can be inspiring, motivational or just make someone's day a little better <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FmAlHc.gif"/><br>
my old accounts were not really making this project work very well.. but well, i'll write more about this in the q&a !<br>
( i already made the necessary edits in the faq and the project page )<br>
<br>
it took me a while to know what i should post on my new instagram acc, since i would like it to be something original and helpful ..<br>
i was thinking of using it as a "spam" acc, but my posts ended up being more helpful than i expected,, so it ended up becoming a "self care" acc !<br>
my posts are all stuffies and the next slides are screenshots from the "help" page of my site ( yes, thiiis one )<br>
i always wanted these tips to reach more people, and since not everyone is used to personal websites and stuff, this was a good way for me to actually help more people !!<br>
<br><br>

<br>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br>
isn't it cute ? i'm proud .. ; ;<br>
my acc is full of friends and mutuals that i love very much.. ! many precious and sweet people. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/T6GBoM4.gif"/><br>
i want to keep it a healthy and safe environment there. i want to motivate them to be happier and feel valid !!<br>
<br>
i also started doing "story games" and even a "mood calendar" to entertain everyone while helping them with self improvement !<br>
i used the "small moments" once and the "mood calendar" for a week, but i don't think i'll continue using them myself since i'm making a new diary where i'll write things down in a more private way <img src="https://i.imgur.com/73rqGP2.gif"/><br>

<br><br>
modesty aside, i honestly think it became much prettier than i expected ..<br>
and i'm so happy because my aesthetic is inspiring other people !!<br>
i always feel my heart warm when i see that people are being inspired by me ///<br>
<br>
today, the text will be about this renewal of my internet life !<br>
a complement to a text i've written before, about "numbers".<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
i'm little by little getting more and more clean of the "numbers", and it's making me feel really good and refreshed.. !<br>
now i officially got rid of all of my social media with big follower numbers. yes, i did my best there, i spent time and effort posting content, but now it's time to refresh things.<br>
i was just really tired of all of this.. random strangers following me just because of a random viral post, creeps messaging me, my accs turning to feel important and platforms treating it like nothing.. so stressful !!<br>
i writed my reasons, and i honestly think these changes are an improvement for me and the quality of my content ♡<br>
even if not using social media for posting personal content, it's still the best way to reach people and make friends. this is what i wanted, from the begin, and just now i'm being able to actually reach people's hearts !<br>
the thing is,, my accs with lots of random people and artificial interactions were consuming my patience and time and i couldn't actually interact with others because it wasn't even safe to try approaching them ; people were also thinking i was distant and hard to approach. i want to have more time for healthy relationships and for myself.<br>
now with my new accs i want to be more spontaneous and helpful to others, i want to make friends and approach people safely, i want to be able to interact with my friends and be there for everyone who needs me, i want to support people i admire and i want it to be soft !! i want my life to be softer, in general.<br>
i'm happy to say that this is becoming reality ♡<br>
i'm ironically being able to reach a higher number of people now than before, not with just cute stuff but my feelings too, and i believe it's because i'm doing better and being more sincere. i now can say i truly care about every single people that interact with my posts, because i can actually enter their accs and see they're trying their best too !!<br>
this is what being "mutuals" means to me : to have our hearts connected by the same motivation and energies. even if i am not in fact "mutuals" with all my followers, i always look at their profile and check from time to time if they are active and if they are good people. i don't want ghost followers and people who never care about my content, i'm going to try to keep a proportion of followers and interactions as reasonable as possible from now on ! my large accounts always had infinitely less interactions than the number of followers, which means that obviously many of those accounts were inactive or people who didn't even care about who they're following. i don't want it anymore. i want real people, a comfortable and safe ambient for me and everyone ! the internet can be a place full of illusions. i believe the numbers are one of the most dangerous illusions.<br>
i feel lighthearted now, and i'm being able to communicate with others better and doing what i wanted from the begin : reaching your hearts and soften your feelings !<br>
i couldn't do it if my heart wasn't soft, right ?<br>
i feel softer now.. i'm happy life made me see how artificial and unnecessary all these numbers are. i learned that real people are important ; kind and lovely people, who will be there. ♡<br>
and i will be there, too ! even with the distance, i am here.<br>
<br>
i hope i can inspire you to improve your internet life, too..<br>
is it really healthy and safe for you, right now ?<br>

it's 2019 !!!<br>
i hope this year is full of happy memories for all of us ♡<br>
i took a while to have the energy to do this post, i'm in a bad phase ; ;<br>
summer is a hard time for me, especially when it comes to sleep ..<br>
my sleep routine is a mess, i'm tired all day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oo6x07s.gif"/><br>
i want to improve it.. i want to feel more energetic so i can do my projects !!<br>
<br>
anyway, i'm feeling happy ♡<br>
i went through some sad moments but with the support of my loved ones i was able to overcome all this and to learn many things <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XBEw3Wi.gif"/><br>
i know all difficulties are important because it's with them that we face problems, fears and insecurities and we improve !!!<br>
if you are going through something hard now, remember this.. everything will be better soon !<br>
<br>
i have today to show you a collage that i'm very proud of <img src="https://i.imgur.com/piFKEDh.gif"/><br>

<br><br>
so.. double q&a !!<br>
the first one will be a complement to something i've written before, about age regression. the second one will be about "role in life" ♡<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ଢ ⅰ<br>
i've been thinking about age regression lately, because i really am into all kind of age regression activities and stuff.. but i still know that i don't really age regress, because i'm always like it.<br>
i don't really feel a difference when i'm coloring or eating using a cute spoon, because it's just my personality. i could say everytime i'm feeling comfy i'm regressed, but i don't really feel it as a thiiing, because it's just who i am.. !<br>
i think age regression is valid, because it really is important for some people to find their purity and innocence again.. and i still really like being into agere activities and stuff, but i don't consider myself into the "little space" thing ( i'm talking about non kink age regression, i'm just using the expression.. ) because if so, i would constantly be into it, and the thing about regression is exactly the contrast between feeling adult and childish.<br>
i have matured a lot and learned things through the time, but the way i see the world and my personality definitively is the same as ever, because this is exactly what i value !<br>
when i think about myself with 8 years old, i can see clearly that i'm the same, and will always be. i don't need to regress.<br>
i want to keep myself pure and innocent, imaginative, positive.. i always try my best to remain all the good important things about myself, even if sometimes i have to be really adult and strong, i'm still being myself all the time.. i'll never change, just mature and get better and smarter !!<br>
i can be an adult and still be the same as always, just changing moods and choosing important personality traits for each situation ! i can have childish interests, because my interests are important, it doesn't matter if it's childish.. i also have lots of grandma interests like embroidery, baking, and i know i'm not a grandma ( yet )<br>
of course adult stuff is really stressful, so bubu always help me.. he takes care of me. is he my caregiver ? yes, but i also take care of him ! we always help each other in everything ♡<br>
since i've remained the same, i don't feel the need to regress, because i'm already regressed. i'm just myself.. always !<br>
if you have a hard time being yourself and feeling comfortable about your interests, personality and behavior, don't feel guilty about regressing.. there will be this contrast between feeling big and small that will make you feel like wanting to regress all the time, but someday you'll also feel always just like yourself, and be really happy about it ♡ !<br>
it is possible to be pure, innocent, happy and comfy even as an adult.. and i'm trying my best to get there !!!<br>
<br>

the meaning of things is usually something melancholy to think about, since although things all happen with a reason, these reasons are so vague and neutral that they don't satisfy us. things happen because they need to happen, but they can be painful and it's impossible to stop the pain. for example, we feel sad if we are lonely, but we also feel sad if we love people and they are gone ( and one day they will ). it's inevitable.<br>
but i don't like to think of things in a pessimistic way, so i've always focused on something that i call "my role in life". this is what i must fulfill and that is what motivates me every day. it's something very simple, but at the same time so complicated.. to be happy.<br>
nothing in life makes sense if you're not happy, but anything and everything becomes magical if you feel happy. it doesn't really matter if that was fate or not, if happiness is just chemical produced by your brain, because the feeling is magical and welcoming. all good feelings : excitement, comfort, satisfaction, passion.. all of them are the goals in our lives. if nature has given us such good feelings to encourage us to keep going, i believe that is what we should do.<br>
i realized that to achieve my happiness i must have a pure heart, full of love.. i need innocence to enjoy all the wonderful little things of life in complitude. if i had been born in different living conditions, with another DNA, i certainly would not be the one i know today. i would not have learned or experienced the same things, so i would be someone else ; but that doesn't diminish for me the importance of purity. it's not about fitting into some pattern of pure and perfect angel, but rather embracing with all your heart all that your life has offered you until today and thereby forming your personality in the most positive way possible. every single person have purity, every one may be the best within one's own existence.<br>
something that makes me truly happy is to be able to teach how to be the best version of yourself, spreading happiness, love and sharing everything i've learned to this day. although i can't reach many people, although i can't really interfere with their lives and make them happy, i do my best. i want to continue to the end of my life being as happy as i can and helping other people as much as i can, especially the ones i love.<br>
some people will never learn to be happy, some people will never truly love. perhaps, the life given them did not bring enough information. maybe they just have a different way of seeing life. i believe it doesn't matter the way you see things, your personality or your appearance, for these are just consequences of your life, easily moldable. what matters is that inside your heart you can feel the warmth and magic that is love. if you love, you can become better, there is hope ♡ !<br>
<br>

hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NJAC8XR.gif"/><br>
do you have the xmas spirit <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WpkdfFD.gif"/>?<br>
i'm willing to bring this comfort and warmth to you through this post ♡<br>
as you know, where i live is summer right now, which is very anticlimatic ; ;<br>
i always have difficulties getting into the xmas mood, but i love the xmas SO much !!!!<br>
i always start to live it as soon as halloween is over ( i really love halloween too, by the way )<br>
one of my biggest dreams is to have a white xmas.<br>
i really hope for the day when i will have my first white xmas, and maybe, all the next ones too !<br>
the snow is something magical that i really need to see, it's so important to me ;///;<br>
i wish i could see nature in all its splendor, in its completeness...<br>
if you can have snow where you live, i know that you maybe is used it, but please enjoy this vision and live this experience having in mind that it is something really special !!<br>
<br>
changing the subject, i've been thinking a lot about how i take criticism into consideration, but i especially pay close attention to negative criticism..<br>
i really do believe these are very useful for my personal improvement, but i think i've begun to take generalized negative criticism into consideration, which is a no no <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8eY00cR.gif"/><br>
for example, when people generally talk negative things about humans, girls, anything that applies to me, i keep evaluating my behavior to see if i'm doing these bad things too<br>
the problem is that even when i realize that i am not doing anything bad, at all, and that the comment was true but generalized, i still feel sad because the image of who i am is at first bad, right ?<br>
i think it's important for my maturation to realize that people's opinions can really be very negative about me at first, but if they are not true, i should not be worrying about it. it only hurts me.<br>
it's natural to people who generalize opinions and stereotype things and people, and if these are bad things, i naturally have to overcome them by myself, and not try to "clean the image" of all people, if after all, they are not doing their best too.<br>
i think this is an important lesson !!<br>
<br>
do you also evaluate your behavior frequently ?<br>
being the best that i can makes me very happy, but it's tiring when i'm being too strict with myself ///<br>
i will focus on giving my best to give pride to those who know me <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZOQNPSP.gif"/><br>
it's hard to think a lot, but i feel very lucky to be a person and be able to have my heart connected with those i love & with nature ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
i want my feelings to reach you, especially this xmas <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SG2ZwhZ.gif"/><br>
<br>
now i would like to show you a very special playlist that i made to enter the xmas mood :<br>

<br>
i would like to comment that i have received some line stickers recently, from bubu, and i feel so identified with them ! it's literally me !!!<br>
besides the appearance, i really always identified myself in some way with alice !<br>
i especially identify with the feeling of dissociation, lack of reality and irritability that she shows in the course of the story.<br>
i think my life was very marked by that, and it was a way for me to be able to understand who i really am and to deal with the world around me, while understanding what fantasies are and their power over reality !<br>
okay, i may be going a little far ///<br>
anyway, here she is :<br>

today, the q&a will not be double, but i hope you like the subject i chose !<br>
i think it can be very motivational and clarifying.<br>

i always see people talking about the girls' rivalry very aggressively, as if girls hated and competed with each other all the time.. i've been thinking a lot about it because i've always seen rivalry in a positive way in my life, but it was not always positive. i think i've come up with an explanation about it that makes a lot of sense :<br>
to begin with, girls naturally rival each other, differently than boys do. boys also compete, but usually in more objective situations, as in a specific competition or at a specific point to achieve a goal. this type of competition is what we see in games, for example. it's frustrating if you lose, but however mature enough to deal with, that's okay ; it's nothing personal. this type of competition happens between boys and girls alike, but it is not the same as female rivalry.<br>
female rivalry is something very subjective, and that's exactly why it's so interesting, and productive. when girls compare themselves with others in an objective way, they feel sad and can feel envy, which is bad and destructive to self-esteem and relationships ; but this is just a wrong and immature way of dealing with female rivalry ! it doesn't have to be this way ; ;<br>
i've suffered comparing myself directly to other girls, but i've learned that healthy rivalry is when you compare yourself subjectively. all girls tend to have life goals that are naturally very subjective, which even they can't perceive. it's those kinds of goals that you couldn't write exactly in a list and just take some steps to get there - in fact, you might never get there - and that's extremely motivating ♡ !!!<br>
comparing yourself to other girls looking at them as inspirations and looking at their achievements as motivation is something that always makes me feel very happy and inspired to be a better girl as well. to be a better person. i feel extremely motivated when i meet a girl who has life goals similar to mine ( things like being a purer, gentler, wiser person ) and on the same level that i feel that i don't want to lose to her, i don't want to be behind her, i want to reach her !! just as i want to be free to follow my own path, not hers ; i want to be just as a good girl as she is, not to be exactly like her. i want to be myself, the best i can be. seeing other girls being the best they can be fills my heart with joy and i definitely consider them rivals ! i want them to get better every day, just like me ♡ !!<br>
the rivalry between girls is something wonderful and incredible, not for compare us objectively, but subjectively.<br>
<br>
do you fluffies agree on what i wrote ?<br>
please, give me your opinions and additions ♡ !<br>
i wish you all the most beautiful and peaceful xmas !!!<br>
