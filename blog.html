hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CjTYdnd.gif"/><br>
aaa ♡ i have good news, and some updates !!<br>
i got a new camera, i'm so excited, i already took some beautiful pictures <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j2HpytF.gif"/><br>
i used to take pictures with my old phone or my mom's camera, which is good, but it was not always possible, so it kept me from taking pictures of some specific things like some of my crafts and.. well, myself.<br>
because of that, my pictures were usually inconsistent quality and it bothered me a lot ; ;<br>
i felt insecure and confused about posting my pics so many were randomly posted on my tumblr or facebook pages ///<br>
so now, i decided to organize my folders and just kept the beautiful, good quality pics. i deleted a lot of old stuff and even updated the look book page, the "about" pic and the portfolio.<br>
i decided to just make one session for my pictures in the look book and make them temporary ( i usually get tired of looking at old photos at some point so i know they will be deleted sometime ).<br>
this session will be for pictures of myself in general, because i don't really take pics of my looks or my face often, but more "specific" pics. i never knew where to post these here, so now i have a place.<br>
some old pics will be reposted from time to time, so i will not specify dates !<br>
i still don't think i'll post selfies often anyway, and i'll keep taking pictures with pajamas and nightgowns, because as i've said before, it's how i usually feel comfortable. also, i probably will not stop posting some pics anonymously out there.. i'm very shy, sorry ///<br>
i still have lots of updates to do about it + i'll post my crafts more often, so stay tuned ♡ !<br>
<br>
as you may have noticed, i also made some changes to my inactive accounts.<br>
i deleted my already inactive 8tracks acc, i had not deleted until today because i used to listen to some playlists there, but the site changes completely prevented me from doing this and i was annoyed.. there was no reason to continue there, since i couldn't even listen to my own playlists... <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fx1iziF.gif"/><br>
i also updated some images and erased some unnecessary posts in my facebook profile. i still keep it to keep in touch with some people over there + manage the pages.<br>
about the instagram account i decided to clean it completely and change everything, including the name. i did this because looking at the the old pictures were making me uncomfortable, they were not very good. also, i was getting many messages from confused people with my absence. i'll keep the acc because i want to keep in touch with some people, besides i always see very beautiful content there !<br>
i hope these changes haven't been uncomfortable for anyone, i just like to keep things organized ///<br>
<br>
now, i have a ( kinda old ) sketch that i painted recently :<br>

do you like when i post papercrafts here ?<br>
i plan to post more crafts in future posts.<br>
<br>
so today what's going to be double !<br>
the first text is about something i felt the need to talk about but that is not reeeally a subject : about my arguments in my texts in general.<br>
then i also wrote about a second subject : immigration. this topic seems to be "feared" by some people nowadays, but i think it's relevant to talk about it because it's in some way a reality in my life and will also include information about my future plans that you were curious about, so let's just get into it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j9db2cK.gif"/><br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
　ⅰ.<br>
people who read my huge texts here may notice that my arguments for all subjects have some patterns, i might say, characteristic of me.<br>
i always explain my reasonings to the conclusions, opinions, and "solutions to problems" that i arrive at ; but this doesn't seem to be clear enough to explain why i always think in a specific way and come up with texts that are so deep, sentimental and at the same time logical.<br>
the thing is exactly that ! i take into consideration all the parts that make up who i am. i am a human being who has rationality to be able to reflect on things and observe situations with an "impartial", rational and logical perception ; but i also have feelings, which are what guide me to questioning things and wanting to be happy, helping me and helping those i love, by getting answers to problems. despite having the sentimental side clearly stronger than the rational one, i strive to balance both when thinking about things and also to write my texts, so that i can get more consistent and useful answers. i don't always get it right because i have hormones that affect my cognitive ability from time to time, i'm an animal ( female, which makes me on the other hand get particular facility in other things, which i also try to make the most of ) but i only write my texts when i am in the mood to reach balanced conclusions.<br>
i think what makes the difference in my arguments to most people is that although i know that i am not the most mature and experienced person, not having much knowledge in specific areas, i always look for answers within myself and in the nature, which is what inevitably controls us. we are all composed of mind, body and soul ; our mind carry the ability to rationalize, our body carry feelings and instincts, our soul carry our pure essence. people usually focus on the part they are most comfortable using and form arguments based on that particular part, but that causes problems ; ;<br>
if you just focus on the mind you will make arguments that are insensitive, extreme and that will not bring happiness ; if you focus on the feelings you will make arguments that will not be useful, perhaps childish and very melancholy ; if you focus on the instincts you will make primitive and inconsistent arguments ; if you focus on the soul you will make arguments that are usually religious and too abstract to be understood. what i strive to do is to use the feelings ( which are my strength ) to guide me through the questions, then use all the other parts to form my arguments and respond to the problems consistently and clearly. my arguments are gentle and soft, natural, extremely sincere and even without having great academic background it's not just "all over the place". it's always thought to bring me happy and working responses, even though we are animals and nature is neutral, we can understand and work with it if we use all the parts that make us up properly.<br>
i know that my texts are focused on being personal and may not work for many people because they have opinions of their own, and i always encourage you to reflect personally to find your own answers. anyway, i think my way to get to the arguments in a balanced way is a healthy practice and i recommend it to everyone ♡ !<br>
i'm utterly happy to know that you like to read what i write, since it's something that comes from my heart ( and everything else ).<br>
<br>
<br>
　ⅱ.<br>
this is a complex subject and currently controversial so i'll start by explaining my point of view before talking about my personal experience :<br>
animals evolve over time to adapt to the places where they live, animals have always immigrated ( intentionally or unintentionally ) to the entire planet and this gives us the variety of species breeds we see today. with humans it was not different, our different races and physical types exist because we are animals that had to adapt evolving in the past, when this was very necessary ; not that it's no longer necessary since we continue in this process, but our small physical differences don't affect us in a very relevant way nowadays because we have been able to adapt our homes, clothes, food and everything necessary according to the local needs. this allows us to be able to survive anywhere in the world ( the more money, the more quality of life, if you choose a "difficult" place for you ).<br>
because of this, i completely support immigration, even though humans ( like all other animals ) have a "proper" place in the world according to their races and physical type, we don't need to follow these adaptations as long as we have the technology needed for our quality of life. i support that people can live wherever they want, out of necessity or for fun, we are all free to come and go on planet earth since we can have comfort through our efforts as a rational species ( for this reason, there are also no problems in being mixed nowadays ).<br>
my family and my descendants are made up of people from europe who came to brazil at a time when living there was very bad, while here was a wonderful and very comfortable place. it was the best choice for them at the time, and i don't think they did anything wrong because my family lived very well in the old days because of it. but a common problem especially in this type of drastic immigration ( from a completely different place to another ) is that future generations will find themselves in an increasingly worse situation of adaptation. my family doesn't have very good financial situation these days, and as i said earlier, if the place on earth is difficult for you to adapt, it takes more money to supply your needs.<br>
currently, living in brazil is not good for me or my family, we are not comfortable in many ways. our food is good but the weather is really a nuisance for me, although i absolutely loving the blue sky and the birds that live on my roof and sing every morning all year long, loving my mother tongue, loving many local foods and fruits ( that i'll take with me wherever i live ); the summers are getting more and more uncomfortable. but this is the "small" personal reason why i want to go back to europe ; i really want to form a family and the violence in my country is really something frighteningly common, besides the fact that the country is also not economically well. these are many problems that used to exist when my great great grandparents suffered when they decided to live in brazil. i want to go back to europe to give my children a good life and to be happier ♡ !<br>
fortunately, i can do that, and obviously i support that kind of attitude and i think immigration is great in many ways. they can cause problems for future generations, as it did for me, but this can be solved with more immigration and it is not something that has "ruined" my family or something, as some people often imagine ( ??? )<br>
i like brazil as well as i like anywhere else in the world, it is a beautiful and special place and i have obviously a special affection for this place has been where i was born and lived until today, but europe is where i want to live now and i think it's a good choice for being my "home" location, biologically speaking.<br>
besides, i would like to comment on other "immigration" details that relate to humans... i don't support raising animals or plants in very different places from their natural habitat unless it's done in a comfortable environment under carefully adaptation, and obviously without overloading the environment ( large-scale agriculture or animal breeding that are not locally appropriate affect the environment and are harmful to literally everyone, i utterly disapprove of these practices ).<br>
<br>
well, that's it, i hope i've expressed myself clearly !!<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rg8poHP.gif"/><br>
i realize how this website has grown since its creation and i am very proud of the progress <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3SNUoL5.gif"/><br>
i'm doing my best to bring frequent updates and useful content to you !!<br>
please ask me complex questions to write about, it's hard to think about subjects that seem relevant..<br>
i get many questions that would not really do a good q&a, you know ?<br>
<br>
you know that i have a routine page, i have schedules to do certain things and daily tasks, this helps me a lot to organize things, as well as my weekly listings and schedules.<br>
of course life doesn't always collaborate and we have to make adaptations, but it is great to have a base to know what to do and not waste time.<br>
so, i've been trying hard to spend less time on the internet lately !<br>
if i'm forced to do this i always find a way to do everything in a short time, but it is difficult to have discipline when i have free time ; ;<br>
some of my tasks require the internet, so i defined a period of 3 hours a day as the maaaaximum time on the internet, on those more complicated days ; but i usually spend 2 hours or even 1 hour and i'm very happy about it ♡ !<br>
it's a very important practice, especially for those who do many "quiet" activities like me, it is necessary to space these times to stretch, drink water, make snacks and take some air outside.<br>
in fact, i would like to clarify that i don't really wake up 6 am going to sleep 1 am, it would be torture.. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NtMNFpN.gif"/><br>
i just get up to watch the sunrise ( when it's possible, i really like doing it ), so i also eat a fruit and plan my day ; if it's very hot i like to take a shower to refresh, then i go back to sleep until 10 am !<br>
i just really wake up at 6 am if i need to and in that case i always go to bed before midnight.<br>
<br>
i was writing lots of letters lately and thinking.. sometimes i get a little annoyed with my handwriting because it's very... childish <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Clflx9p.gif"/><br>
i don't know how to explain, i don't think it's ugly, it's kinda cute ; but it's a little clumsy, small and "roundy", it's the same handwriting that i see in my old school notebooks !!<br>
if you have already exchanged letters with me or have already seen my handwriting fonts you will understand.<br>
( by the way, if you are interested in exchanging letters don't hesitate to contact me in the email because i love doing this ♡ )<br>
i really like calligraphy so i train a lot, i like to write in different letters to make decorated titles and "aesthetic" texts, but my natural handwriting really is childish and there's nothing i can do about it ; ;<br>
they say people's handwriting reflects their personality, i know everyone has a unique handwriting that is a "brand" of them and that's very special ♡<br>
but it is impossible not to envy people who have naturally mature and elegant handwriting ///<br>
well, i can "simulate" this if i really want to, but it's not the same since it inevitably doesn't suit me very much so i usually just prefer to be myself.<br>
<br>
enough of talking, today the post will have a super cute drawing that i painted ♡ !<br>

<br><br>
have you ever seen people who are so beautiful, kind and have a lovely aura that makes everyone feel comfortable and safe around ? it seems like a rare and precious personality trait, like this person knows nothing bad and lives in a beautiful and different reality.<br>
in fact, i have learned over time that this is a skill to be acquired with maturity. bad experiences don't influence who you really are and shouldn't make you have a heavy and sad aura. bad experiences happen for you to mature and to be able to avoid them in the future, as well as helping other people in a similar situation ; traumas are not part of you, all bad things you've been through, you've seen or just know that exist, none of that is part of you and none of that represents your reality.<br>
you should never become ignorant, keep yourself informed of the world situation and mold your opinions is very important to live healthy and safe ! however, it is extremely important to keep yourself pure despite all this. purity will give you a different aura and will make your reality, in fact, beautiful.<br>
don't let bad thoughts and memories affect you continuously ; boring and ugly things are a part of life and you really should deal with them properly and don't ignore them, but you should not make them a personal problem. on daily basis you should forget everything bad and only think of beautiful and pleasant things that you live, lived and would like to live : daydream, watch the sky, pick flowers, write love letters, wear perfume, put on pajamas all day, wear your favorite dress casually ! life has many opportunities for you to make it beautiful and create good memories for you to keep and share with others.<br>
surround yourself with beautiful things, embellish ugly things you don't like to look at, cherish people who love you & move away from people who are toxic to you. small details in your life can greatly help shaping your ability to be positive and emanate kindness and beauty ♡<br>
<br>
remember : the kinder you are, the more beautiful you become ( and that includes being kind to yourself )<br>

i think this activity is very good for practicing dealing with aesthetics other than my main one, and as i've been aiming to improve my "beautifying" skills i'm doing my best to try different things while maintaining my individuality.<br>
do you think i'm doing well ?<br>

it's soft and friendly, just like a teddy bear, so i think it fits well <img src="https://i.imgur.com/x3yjjEc.gif"/><br>
<br>
and talking about teddy bears, i had a sudden idea when i saw my png folder and realized that i had a lot of stuffed animals in there ( 56 specifically )<br>
i had to do something with them urgently, they can't just be homeless and all over the place <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dwoRLsQ.gif"/><br>
so i started to make a html page that was comfortable to store them, organizing my virtual stuffie collection !!!<br>

with, of course, a cute url ( bear.shop.tm )<br>
i really enjoyed doing it and i'm very pleased with the result. did you like it ♡ ?<br>
<br>
today i want to write some important tips to you who often feel dissociated and confused with your very existence.<br>
it is a very complicated subject, but i know what i'm going to say here is a good introduction to reflections and learning that you will have to follow on your own ; getting started is usually difficult so i'll say the method i chose to better understand myself, my passions and goals.<br>
will i really be able to help someone with these words ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gy3kOEy.gif"/><br>
i wish from the bottom of my heart !<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i know that the pursuit of self-knowledge is something that never ends, but i, being young, realize that young people usually seek to be special in some way, seeking individuality. the thing is that we are all different and have individualities already, if you don't know which ones you can't enjoy this right, you can't be yourself and improve, so you just become artificial and sad. adults also don't usually know who they are, they just let it go, it makes them more and more faded, which is extremely sad. feeling dissociated and not knowing who you are is a bad feeling and should not be taken to life, so i will try to help you by saying how i managed to understand who i really am and my individuality, i hope it can help some of you too !<br>
something that helped me a lot to understand who i am were the aesthetics. i know this is a very recent term and it may seem rather silly and superficial, but you can call it other things too, since it has always existed : style, spectrum, tendency, essence.. i like to call it aesthetics because i am quite visual, but you must understand that what i mean by that is the essence of who you are, represented through visuals, personality, lifestyle, passions and others.<br>
we are very stimulated seeing beautiful and wonderful things everywhere, aesthetics that we want for ourselves. the problem is that we can not be all things, although we have different moods and personal tastes, there are limits to who we can be ; when you go beyond these limits you feel dissociated and uncomfortable. only you can know who you really are and when you're not being yourself, so you must first learn to understand your feelings and not be carried away by the desires of being someone different, you are perfect being who you are, people are beautiful and perfect in different ways ( and only when they are being themselves ).<br>
you certainly have personal tastes and should not suppress them to fit into groups, your personal tastes help you a lot to understand your personal essence ( we don't really can choose to like things voluntarily, we just like it ). i discovered who i am separating my personal tastes : whenever i had to choose a color, a music, a food, a place, above all others, although i like lots of different things, i always had a specific preference , there was a clear pattern in these things, despite different moods. in this way, through experimentation, i was able to discover my favorite aesthetic. and i must say, you will not find yours coming from someone else, you will only find elements that will compose your personal aesthetic. aesthetics carry specific messages and feelings, so you must understand what you are looking for.<br>
it may seem confusing, but for example, i started by just liking cute, delicate, and feminine things ; within that there may be infinite variations, so i sometimes felt confused and uncomfortable with some cute things that did not really match me. "but i like cute stuff, what's the problem ??" i thought. the problem is that i am me, i am a person, people are complex. i began to realize that i felt artificial when trying to adhere some elements that didn't represent me ( despite being visually alike, carried different feelings ). gradually i separated the elements and composed some aesthetics that i really liked and i felt comfortable about it, until i discovered my ult fav one.<br>
i have a tip for you : always think about the adjectives that define things, these adjectives should complement and make sense to you, should be pleasant and make you feel good ( even the negative ones ). you must do this with all things, not just with visuals, since your essence is present in all the things that make up you.<br>
by understanding who you are, it will be much easier to self improve, you will be able to have healthier relationships and help people, you will have better self esteem, you will better understand your personality ( and therefore take better care of yourself as you will understand your limits ), you will be able to find hobbies, to find out what you want to do with your life, you will be happier and will continue to be free to enjoy things that "don't fit" your main aesthetic, since this is also part of your individuality and should not be denied. as i always say here, you must always seek purity.<br>
i would like to make it clear that you should think about yourself rather than what others feel about you or how other people "should" see you. only you can know yourself deeply and truthfully. people should see you as you really are, you must be yourself and you should not be a walking lie to please others, therefore you will not please anyone or even yourself ! lies are always bad.<br>

i hope my words are useful ///<br>
