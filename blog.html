hiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6bJBd0e.gif"/><br>
have you been doing your best ?<br>
i've been.. doing a lot ...<br>
i finally opened commissions for website layouts, as you can see on the index page !<br>
i really love web design, but i never felt really like people would really want to pay for my work..<br>
well, after receiving so many questions about my website and how i make it, i decided to open myself to it and did my first commission ♡ !!!<br>
i'm really proud of myself, now i can work hard to make people happy in other ways besides my current projects.<br>
<br>
i also opened a <a id="linkzinho" href="https://ko-fi.com/middlepot" style="text-decoration: none; color:#d16e9b;" target="_blank">ko-fi</a> account, since i really am in need of some money right now for buying a new laptop.. it's been hard working with it, but i'm doing my best ; ;<br>
i have some active projects rn and some more to come that i'm working with, so if you like any of my works please consider supporting me.. ! it would mean the world to me, and help a whole lot.<br>
remember you can now also support me by buying a <a style="text-decoration: none; color:#d16e9b;" id="linkzinho" href="https://middlepot.com/commissions" target="_blank">layout commission</a> or if you're from brazil, buying something from my <a id="linkzinho" href="https://shybunny.middlepot.com" style="text-decoration: none; color:#d16e9b;" target="_blank">online store</a> !<br>
( you can also buy small items on the shy bunny store if you live overseas, just please consider the long delivery time )<br>
<br>
i appreciate a lot all the supporting messages i receive from you all and i want to keep going with my current works, even if most of them don't give me any profit, i still keep going with all my love and dedication <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OhHUZZE.gif"/><br>
i know some of my projects have been stagnant, but i'm not giving up on them, don't worry !<br>
i'm just focusing on my main ones right now, but i will surely take some time for everything i planned.<br>
if you want to see something specifically here or in my accs, please contact me and i will certainly consider it ♡<br>
<br>
eee now, i have today a very cute html page i've been wanting to do for.. a week LOL<br>
it's "my simulation of the perfect imageboard for me"<br>
i out of nowhere wanted to do it because i was remembering all the time i spent on imageboards when i was younger and i always wanted to make a cute and positive one ~<br>
( i don't think people would even enter it actually, it's too girly )<br>
by the way, the q&a today will be about imageboards ! i wanted to talk about it because most people don't really understand the point of these sites and think they're just bad, but it's not really like that.<br>
it's complicated, and i stopped using them for a long time now, but i certainly miss exchanging content and stories with all the interesting people i could find on the weirdest boards !<br>
i specially liked threads about "trying to find" specific content or observing bizarre communities... these became renegade thread themes on ibs over time, and i don't know why, since these were so much fun ??<br>
people seem to only like talking about boring stuff now.. ughie <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dATVv1g.gif"/><br>
well, enough of talking, here :<br>

i think pufchan is adorable ..<br>
it's obviously a fake imageboard, you can't post anything, it's just visuals !<br>
the layout is inspired by futaba, which i believe it's the first "chan". i love the 90s look of it, despite it being born in 2001 ♡<br>
i'm sorry about my weird japanese, i just wanted to make some inside jokes there LOL<br>
i was not very creative about the domain this time, but here we go : pufchan.fr.to<br>
<br>
do you like it ? would you use it ?<br>
only cuteness allowed <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uFeVUJn.gif"/><br>
<br>
now let's go to the q&a and continue the subject..<br>
<br><br>

i have seen many people saying that imageboards are toxic and hateful environments. i have had particularly varied experiences in such environments, not just ibs but other places that are also open to different subjects, and because these are anonymous environments, it is easy to see people saying hateful thoughts...
such people may or may not have gone through difficult things in life and they feel the need to vent terrible things on the internet. i consider myself a very patient person with open environments like this, because i've already been able to talk about very interesting and fun subjects with good-hearted people in places like this. it is possible to have good experiences !
currently, i have found it VERY difficult to find good content, as these places have become the focus of hate texts. i definitely do not support or pay attention to this sort of thing, since it doesn't do any good for anyone.
i used to go to these places with some frequency because it was easy to find ibs where the anonymity was absolute, that is, it was not spoken in gender or any subject that revealed particularities about the users. this avoided most of the unpleasant and problematic issues, leaving room for healthy and interesting discussions. i learned a lot and met very nice people in these spaces. unfortunately, it is a rarity now, and so i consider that the ibs are dead practically all over the world.
many people say they see clear rejections in specific places against groups of people. this is real, but not just in anonymous places, i've seen it all over the internet ( and out of it too ) !!
something very common to see is the classic boys x girls, right x left and other things like that ; ;
if you pay attention, you will find all sorts of people rejecting and avoiding contact with other types of people, because they had bad experiences multiple times. this is basically it. i believe that any passive or aggressive rejection against people by their sex, beliefs, tastes, thoughts, is the fruit of past bad experiences. i don't like to judge people by such attitudes as long as they can be understanding, i think no one need to accept interactions with people who don't want to, i think it's important to respect environments made for a specific type of audience. i've never disrespected public rules anywhere because it seems to me too immature to force your presence into places where you're not welcome just to be "edgy" or "revolutionary" ; it's disrespectful to use personal information as an advantage in anonymous places, i don't support this. but obviously i can't stand threatenings or hate texts, as this is sick and negative, i don't like any toxic environment !
i really value respect among people and believe that anonymity should serve to make people "impartial" and away from judgments, to say what they really think, so that it can be productive for the personal development of everyone. it is possible to exchange good arguments and spend good moments of entertainment and learning with people if they respect each other and don't judge for personal details. i believe that anonymity makes environments nicer for complicated topics, an environment becomes pure from the moment people don't have personal information about each other.
please don't be hateful, please don't be mean !! it's hard to deal with differences, but people are not supposed to hate each other. everyone is different and have problems, and that's okay. you don't have to interact with people you don't like, but it's not right to write hate texts ; ;
so i support anonymous discussion environments, and the respect. my good experiences were much more relevant than the bad ones, although i had a hard time finding interesting subjects on the internet, i know it's possible !
unfortunately the ibs have become a very dirty place in recent years, frequented by frustrated teenagers who want to feel special and part of some sort of "secret movement" that rules the world through memes... seriously. although i believe myself in the power of memes and the internet, using it to feel better than others is pathetic.
and, fortunately, i still know other places on the internet that are good for that kind of healthy interaction that i quoted above ♡ ! there are not many, but i really like them. things really are temporary, so it's not healthy to keep complaining, right ?
by the way i really don't care about the reputation of the places on the internet, to be honest, so i'm always open to experiencing things before judging them by the contents that spread out there. for example, tumblr has a very dubious and embarrassing reputation, but i have used it for many years and absolutely love the beautiful and interesting content that i find exclusively there. people simply should try before saying anything.
</pre>
<br>
mm.. people can be very judgmental with some places on the internet without any real experience so i think it's fair to give my opinions about it !<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jx8mKKt.gif"/><br>
what are you thinking of the new layout ♡ ?<br>
this one is my favorite layout of all times.. i'm so proud ; ;<br>
i organized everything waaay better, getting rid of some unnecessary pages with repetitive content.. !<br>
now i just have my main project featured, all of my other works can be found here at the blog and the portfolio.<br>
i feel like everything is way better now <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2qFl7Lb.gif"/><br>
<br>
so.. about my new social media i was starting to get.. well, too into it.<br>
but i know that social media are bad, it was making me feel really stressed already ; ;<br>
so i made a promise to myself : i will just open my apps once a day. i still want to keep my "5 hours of internet per week" but it obviously gets harder if i keep my apps open and distracting me !!<br>
this is what i'm doing now :<br>
after waking up i open the apps, i check and respond my friends, i post ( if i have something to post ), then i close the apps.<br>
sometimes i don't respond messages, if i'm tired.. and i try to plan my posts once a week, not every day ( but sometimes i'm just full of ideas )<br>
.. before sleep i like to respond the messages i haven't before, but that's about it !<br>
i'm doing it for some days now and i'm already feeling better <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NcqSAci.gif"/><br>
please be careful about social media ! it is good for making friends and reaching people with your work, but in balance. posting personal things and opening all your apps multiple times a day will only keep you increasingly far from individuality !!!<br>
you must have realized that you start thinking bad things that you would not normally think and feeling "out of place" ; it's because you're being influenced by excessive information.. !<br>
really dangerous ...<br>
<br>
talking about social media, last month i made a "mood calendar" for instagram, but this month i wasn't feeling motivated for that ..<br>
i see many similar calendars everywhere and i didn't see a reason in doing something repetitive like that, but i wanted to continue with that idea, improving it somehow.. !<br>
so i had the idea to do a "self care calendar", much more complete and useful ♡ !!<br>
i'm very proud of it and i hope to have more ideas in the future to continue helping others on a daily basis.<br>
helping people is something i love, because it not just fills my heart with joy but also makes me emotionally stronger !<br>
i feel that i can help myself and people i love better if i've practice beforehand. my own advices and texts help me a lot, and i'm really glad to be able to share it with others and help in any way ♡<br>
<br>
i have been trying to fight against insecurity for the longest time.. just like everyone else.<br>
i think that discovering your individuality is the best way for understanding who you are, what are your flatters and what you can actually improve !<br>
accepting compliments with your heart is very hard, since you don't actually believe these. it doesn't mean they're wrong.<br>
lately i've been feeling particularly insecure about myself because sometime it seems that my personality is just the way it is because of the people i've met, which would mean that i also can change others .. isn't it impure ? wrong ?<br>
actually, i think that it's a natural process of maturing. since we really are shaped with time, it doesn't mean all of it is impurity.. !<br>
i'll write more about it on the q&a today.<br>
<br>
now, the first thing i have to post here is the backup of my last html pages i made !!<br>
it's just a simple scenary collage with all of my favorite sprites of ragnarok online <img src="https://i.imgur.com/d3P2KyD.gif"/><br>
aaand, of course, cute domain : <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://kafra.ro.lt" target="_blank">kafra.ro.lt</a><br>
( i've always admired the kafras, they are inspiration to me /// )<br>
i made sprites of myself in all themes.. this is my fav one :<br>

　✁ ⅰ<br>
the ego is all that you were not naturally, all that you have consumed and learned from life experiences. the ego is not necessarily bad, but it is definitely dangerous..<br>
your ego is the cause of all your insecurities and social problems ; every time you feel dissociated or afraid of other people's opinion about you is because you're trying to make your ego stronger and protect it. the thing is .. you have nothing to be afraid of !<br>
no one can actually stole who you are, even if you feel like you're similar to others in some way of trying to replicate others to become better, it's just your way of learning. it may be not the best way of improving, but it's what you have now, so it's important being patient with yourself !!<br>
everything i've learned and got inspired by others is just what made me improve and mature, it's not a bad thing. i also believe that if i am inspiring others in a good way, it's a good thing !!<br>
it would be impure if i was changing who i am, but i am in fact just polishing myself. i can feel what is artificial and what is not ; so i trust myself to get inspiration and improve with time and experiences.<br>
i realize that overcoming this fear is really important, since it's really hurtful and hard to improve if i keep feeling afraid of trying new things, changing and not being approved by others.. !<br>
i can clearly see when people are truly giving me useful and important criticism, and when they're just trying to make me sad because they're frustrated with themselves. i still feel afraid of making people feel frustrated, but it's inevitable. bad feelings are also part of life, and i feel blessed for being able to feel these things and keep learning from it !!<br>
the ego keeps making me think that i should protect my individuality and my beliefs, that if someone dislike me it's because i'm making something wrong, they're trying to make me unmotivated.. and they're getting it .<br>
this is really bad, i now can see that it's natural if i make mistakes, even if i'm not making mistakes someone will not agree with me, everyone interpret things differently. i just hope people keep growing up and learning.. and they are !<br>
individuality is not something that can be stolen, your ego may seem artificial sometimes but if you keep your purity and just do things that you want from heart, everything is okay ♡<br>
who you are is not just visuals, musical tastes, mannerisms .. you're actually really unique, since ever. no one is truly similar to you, at all ! maybe similar to your ego, but it keeps evolving anyways. it is important to be able to representate your personality through your ego, you can help others to understand themselves and feel really comfortable in your body if you learn to look and act how you think it's the best version of you. if you're not making up your ego for others but using it as a way of expressing yourself, it's healthy and valid !!<br>
embrace your actual perfection, within your abilities and reality ♡♡<br>
everyone is trying, and sometimes there will be mean people out there. you're strong enough for understanding they're just sad and immature, they don't actually care about you personally, if you did nothing wrong. your ego makes you fragile and easily offended, but you have nothing to be afraid of !<br>
these are some important reminders for you and i...<br>
everyone learns to keep their purity in different paces, so if someone can feel suddenly confused and unsatisfied with themselves by trying to copy who i am, it's not my fault .. i always try to make it clear that purity is important..<br>
i just want to be happy, and i want others to be happy too. i know that i must accept who i am and love myself to achieve happiness !<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　✃ ⅱ<br>
i will leave here a brief opinion about age differences in relationships, in general.. !<br>
i never really cared about interacting or even being friends with people older or younger than me. i believe that age is not a factor that defines whether or not a person is nice to have around ; but if the age difference is too big ( more than 5 years ) being too close becomes a problem as there are some limits and certain topics that are not appropriate to talk with people who are living a so different phase from you. if you are a relative, you have a greater freedom to talk and be an influence to that person ( or be influenced ), but when it comes to relationships i think big age differences are not very healthy normally .. it is uncomfortable when someone's is too young or too old to even understand what you're going through right now, and some people can be really toxic : bad advices, unmotivational comments, generalizations...<br>
i've always been and i will always be open to being friendly and being there for all the lovely people who come into my life, regardless of anything, but i find it important to understand my position when i'm interacting with a person of a very different age. i avoid being too close to avoid any uncomfortable situation, since what i seek is just solace for me and for everyone !<br>
if you're too younger or older than me, please don't feel bad ; i still am glad to have you here and i wouldn't reject your interactions. i love making friends and i love having my heart connected with different people from all over the world ♡ !!<br>
i believe that if i keep cautious about what kind of relationship it's healthy to have with people, everything can turn out okay.. !<br>
<br>
<br>
please don't forget to give me feedback, suggestions and questions for future content ♡ !<br>

hiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WBtDHoi.gif"/><br>
so many things have happened in last weeks .. i'm a little overwhelmed, even ; ;<br>
but i'm trying my best to rest and respect my relaxing time !!<br>
it's always hard keeping a routine and schedules, since my body and my mind not always agree with what i'm supposed to do.. but this is also part of a healthy routine !<br>
sometimes we need to adapt the schedule to respect our time and not get too tired.<br>
it's actually common for me to have a full lazy day and the next day i feel super motivated to do all tasks for three days.. !<br>
the important thing is to not pressure myself to follow the routine 100%, since it's supposed to be helpful and not a bother. if i'm doing my weekly tasks and resting properly, everything is ok !!<br>
<br>
so .. you may have noticed some very "drastic" changes in all my social media,,<br>
i was already making a sort of cleaning, but this time.. i just couldn't keep doing it.<br>
i decided to finally stop this pain and actually delete my accounts and make new ones !<br>
i have now new accounts for my "not bad" project ; my social media accs <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PCwccpM.gif"/><br>
i mean, only my tumblr blogs are the same, but i changed urls : now it's @pufti and @pofti, which is really cute and match ( for real now )<br>
as you already know, i don't use social media for personal content but to post actual helpful stuff.. maybe not thaaat helpful but i always try to post things that can be inspiring, motivational or just make someone's day a little better <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FmAlHc.gif"/><br>
my old accounts were not really making this project work very well.. but well, i'll write more about this in the q&a !<br>
( i already made the necessary edits in the faq and the project page )<br>
<br>
it took me a while to know what i should post on my new instagram acc, since i would like it to be something original and helpful ..<br>
i was thinking of using it as a "spam" acc, but my posts ended up being more helpful than i expected,, so it ended up becoming a "self care" acc !<br>
my posts are all stuffies and the next slides are screenshots from the "help" page of my site ( yes, thiiis one )<br>
i always wanted these tips to reach more people, and since not everyone is used to personal websites and stuff, this was a good way for me to actually help more people !!<br>

isn't it cute ? i'm proud .. ; ;<br>
my acc is full of friends and mutuals that i love very much.. ! many precious and sweet people. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/T6GBoM4.gif"/><br>
i want to keep it a healthy and safe environment there. i want to motivate them to be happier and feel valid !!<br>
<br>
i also started doing "story games" and even a "mood calendar" to entertain everyone while helping them with self improvement !<br>
i used the "small moments" once and the "mood calendar" for a week, but i don't think i'll continue using them myself since i'm making a new diary where i'll write things down in a more private way <img src="https://i.imgur.com/73rqGP2.gif"/><br>

<br><br>
modesty aside, i honestly think it became much prettier than i expected ..<br>
and i'm so happy because my aesthetic is inspiring other people !!<br>
i always feel my heart warm when i see that people are being inspired by me ///<br>
<br>
today, the text will be about this renewal of my internet life !<br>
a complement to a text i've written before, about "numbers".<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
i'm little by little getting more and more clean of the "numbers", and it's making me feel really good and refreshed.. !<br>
now i officially got rid of all of my social media with big follower numbers. yes, i did my best there, i spent time and effort posting content, but now it's time to refresh things.<br>
i was just really tired of all of this.. random strangers following me just because of a random viral post, creeps messaging me, my accs turning to feel important and platforms treating it like nothing.. so stressful !!<br>
i writed my reasons, and i honestly think these changes are an improvement for me and the quality of my content ♡<br>
even if not using social media for posting personal content, it's still the best way to reach people and make friends. this is what i wanted, from the begin, and just now i'm being able to actually reach people's hearts !<br>
the thing is,, my accs with lots of random people and artificial interactions were consuming my patience and time and i couldn't actually interact with others because it wasn't even safe to try approaching them ; people were also thinking i was distant and hard to approach. i want to have more time for healthy relationships and for myself.<br>
now with my new accs i want to be more spontaneous and helpful to others, i want to make friends and approach people safely, i want to be able to interact with my friends and be there for everyone who needs me, i want to support people i admire and i want it to be soft !! i want my life to be softer, in general.<br>
i'm happy to say that this is becoming reality ♡<br>
i'm ironically being able to reach a higher number of people now than before, not with just cute stuff but my feelings too, and i believe it's because i'm doing better and being more sincere. i now can say i truly care about every single people that interact with my posts, because i can actually enter their accs and see they're trying their best too !!<br>
this is what being "mutuals" means to me : to have our hearts connected by the same motivation and energies. even if i am not in fact "mutuals" with all my followers, i always look at their profile and check from time to time if they are active and if they are good people. i don't want ghost followers and people who never care about my content, i'm going to try to keep a proportion of followers and interactions as reasonable as possible from now on ! my large accounts always had infinitely less interactions than the number of followers, which means that obviously many of those accounts were inactive or people who didn't even care about who they're following. i don't want it anymore. i want real people, a comfortable and safe ambient for me and everyone ! the internet can be a place full of illusions. i believe the numbers are one of the most dangerous illusions.<br>
i feel lighthearted now, and i'm being able to communicate with others better and doing what i wanted from the begin : reaching your hearts and soften your feelings !<br>
i couldn't do it if my heart wasn't soft, right ?<br>
i feel softer now.. i'm happy life made me see how artificial and unnecessary all these numbers are. i learned that real people are important ; kind and lovely people, who will be there. ♡<br>
and i will be there, too ! even with the distance, i am here.<br>
<br>
i hope i can inspire you to improve your internet life, too..<br>
is it really healthy and safe for you, right now ?<br>
