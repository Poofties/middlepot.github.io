it's 2019 !!!<br>
i hope this year is full of happy memories for all of us ♡<br>
i took a while to have the energy to do this post, i'm in a bad phase ; ;<br>
summer is a hard time for me, especially when it comes to sleep ..<br>
my sleep routine is a mess, i'm tired all day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oo6x07s.gif"/><br>
i want to improve it.. i want to feel more energetic so i can do my projects !!<br>
<br>
anyway, i'm feeling happy ♡<br>
i went through some sad moments but with the support of my loved ones i was able to overcome all this and to learn many things <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XBEw3Wi.gif"/><br>
i know all difficulties are important because it's with them that we face problems, fears and insecurities and we improve !!!<br>
if you are going through something hard now, remember this.. everything will be better soon !<br>
<br>
i have today to show you a collage that i'm very proud of <img src="https://i.imgur.com/piFKEDh.gif"/><br>
i've been saving images with this aesthetic for a loooong time, i love this theme of strawberries and hearts ♡ !<br>

<br><br>
so.. double q&a !!<br>
the first one will be a complement to something i've written before, about age regression. the second one will be about "role in life" ♡<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ଢ ⅰ<br>
i've been thinking about age regression lately, because i really am into all kind of age regression activities and stuff.. but i still know that i don't really age regress, because i'm always like it.<br>
i don't really feel a difference when i'm coloring or eating using a cute spoon, because it's just my personality. i could say everytime i'm feeling comfy i'm regressed, but i don't really feel it as a thiiing, because it's just who i am.. !<br>
i think age regression is valid, because it really is important for some people to find their purity and innocence again.. and i still really like being into agere activities and stuff, but i don't consider myself into the "little space" thing ( i'm talking about non kink age regression, i'm just using the expression.. ) because if so, i would constantly be into it, and the thing about regression is exactly the contrast between feeling adult and childish.<br>
i have matured a lot and learned things through the time, but the way i see the world and my personality definitively is the same as ever, because this is exactly what i value !<br>
when i think about myself with 8 years old, i can see clearly that i'm the same, and will always be. i don't need to regress.<br>
i want to keep myself pure and innocent, imaginative, positive.. i always try my best to remain all the good important things about myself, even if sometimes i have to be really adult and strong, i'm still being myself all the time.. i'll never change, just mature and get better and smarter !!<br>
i can be an adult and still be the same as always, just changing moods and choosing important personality traits for each situation ! i can have childish interests, because my interests are important, it doesn't matter if it's childish.. i also have lots of grandma interests like embroidery, baking, and i know i'm not a grandma ( yet )<br>
of course adult stuff is really stressful, so bubu always help me.. he takes care of me. is he my caregiver ? yes, but i also take care of him ! we always help each other in everything ♡<br>
since i've remained the same, i don't feel the need to regress, because i'm already regressed. i'm just myself.. always !<br>
if you have a hard time being yourself and feeling comfortable about your interests, personality and behavior, don't feel guilty about regressing.. there will be this contrast between feeling big and small that will make you feel like wanting to regress all the time, but someday you'll also feel always just like yourself, and be really happy about it ♡ !<br>
it is possible to be pure, innocent, happy and comfy even as an adult.. and i'm trying my best to get there !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　ଢ ⅱ<br>
the meaning of things is usually something melancholy to think about, since although things all happen with a reason, these reasons are so vague and neutral that they don't satisfy us. things happen because they need to happen, but they can be painful and it's impossible to stop the pain. for example, we feel sad if we are lonely, but we also feel sad if we love people and they are gone ( and one day they will ). it's inevitable.<br>
but i don't like to think of things in a pessimistic way, so i've always focused on something that i call "my role in life". this is what i must fulfill and that is what motivates me every day. it's something very simple, but at the same time so complicated.. to be happy.<br>
nothing in life makes sense if you're not happy, but anything and everything becomes magical if you feel happy. it doesn't really matter if that was fate or not, if happiness is just chemical produced by your brain, because the feeling is magical and welcoming. all good feelings : excitement, comfort, satisfaction, passion.. all of them are the goals in our lives. if nature has given us such good feelings to encourage us to keep going, i believe that is what we should do.<br>
i realized that to achieve my happiness i must have a pure heart, full of love.. i need innocence to enjoy all the wonderful little things of life in complitude. if i had been born in different living conditions, with another DNA, i certainly would not be the one i know today. i would not have learned or experienced the same things, so i would be someone else ; but that doesn't diminish for me the importance of purity. it's not about fitting into some pattern of pure and perfect angel, but rather embracing with all your heart all that your life has offered you until today and thereby forming your personality in the most positive way possible. every single person have purity, every one may be the best within one's own existence.<br>
something that makes me truly happy is to be able to teach how to be the best version of yourself, spreading happiness, love and sharing everything i've learned to this day. although i can't reach many people, although i can't really interfere with their lives and make them happy, i do my best. i want to continue to the end of my life being as happy as i can and helping other people as much as i can, especially the ones i love.<br>
some people will never learn to be happy, some people will never truly love. perhaps, the life given them did not bring enough information. maybe they just have a different way of seeing life. i believe it doesn't matter the way you see things, your personality or your appearance, for these are just consequences of your life, easily moldable. what matters is that inside your heart you can feel the warmth and magic that is love. if you love, you can become better, there is hope ♡ !<br>
<br>
mm i'd like to thank you, if you really read everything i write ..<br>
means a lot to me ; ; ♡<br>
this is my valentine's day gift for you :<br>

do you have the xmas spirit <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WpkdfFD.gif"/>?<br>
i'm willing to bring this comfort and warmth to you through this post ♡<br>
as you know, where i live is summer right now, which is very anticlimatic ; ;<br>
i always have difficulties getting into the xmas mood, but i love the xmas SO much !!!!<br>
i always start to live it as soon as halloween is over ( i really love halloween too, by the way )<br>
one of my biggest dreams is to have a white xmas.<br>
i really hope for the day when i will have my first white xmas, and maybe, all the next ones too !<br>
the snow is something magical that i really need to see, it's so important to me ;///;<br>
i wish i could see nature in all its splendor, in its completeness...<br>
if you can have snow where you live, i know that you maybe is used it, but please enjoy this vision and live this experience having in mind that it is something really special !!<br>
<br>
changing the subject, i've been thinking a lot about how i take criticism into consideration, but i especially pay close attention to negative criticism..<br>
i really do believe these are very useful for my personal improvement, but i think i've begun to take generalized negative criticism into consideration, which is a no no <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8eY00cR.gif"/><br>
for example, when people generally talk negative things about humans, girls, anything that applies to me, i keep evaluating my behavior to see if i'm doing these bad things too<br>
the problem is that even when i realize that i am not doing anything bad, at all, and that the comment was true but generalized, i still feel sad because the image of who i am is at first bad, right ?<br>
i think it's important for my maturation to realize that people's opinions can really be very negative about me at first, but if they are not true, i should not be worrying about it. it only hurts me.<br>
it's natural to people who generalize opinions and stereotype things and people, and if these are bad things, i naturally have to overcome them by myself, and not try to "clean the image" of all people, if after all, they are not doing their best too.<br>
i think this is an important lesson !!<br>
<br>
do you also evaluate your behavior frequently ?<br>
being the best that i can makes me very happy, but it's tiring when i'm being too strict with myself ///<br>
i will focus on giving my best to give pride to those who know me <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZOQNPSP.gif"/><br>
it's hard to think a lot, but i feel very lucky to be a person and be able to have my heart connected with those i love & with nature ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
i want my feelings to reach you, especially this xmas <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SG2ZwhZ.gif"/><br>
<br>
now i would like to show you a very special playlist that i made to enter the xmas mood :<br>

<br>
i would like to comment that i have received some line stickers recently, from bubu, and i feel so identified with them ! it's literally me !!!<br>
besides the appearance, i really always identified myself in some way with alice !<br>
i especially identify with the feeling of dissociation, lack of reality and irritability that she shows in the course of the story.<br>
i think my life was very marked by that, and it was a way for me to be able to understand who i really am and to deal with the world around me, while understanding what fantasies are and their power over reality !<br>
okay, i may be going a little far ///<br>
anyway, here she is :<br>

today, the q&a will not be double, but i hope you like the subject i chose !<br>
i think it can be very motivational and clarifying.<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
i always see people talking about the girls' rivalry very aggressively, as if girls hated and competed with each other all the time.. i've been thinking a lot about it because i've always seen rivalry in a positive way in my life, but it was not always positive. i think i've come up with an explanation about it that makes a lot of sense :<br>
to begin with, girls naturally rival each other, differently than boys do. boys also compete, but usually in more objective situations, as in a specific competition or at a specific point to achieve a goal. this type of competition is what we see in games, for example. it's frustrating if you lose, but however mature enough to deal with, that's okay ; it's nothing personal. this type of competition happens between boys and girls alike, but it is not the same as female rivalry.<br>
female rivalry is something very subjective, and that's exactly why it's so interesting, and productive. when girls compare themselves with others in an objective way, they feel sad and can feel envy, which is bad and destructive to self-esteem and relationships ; but this is just a wrong and immature way of dealing with female rivalry ! it doesn't have to be this way ; ;<br>
i've suffered comparing myself directly to other girls, but i've learned that healthy rivalry is when you compare yourself subjectively. all girls tend to have life goals that are naturally very subjective, which even they can't perceive. it's those kinds of goals that you couldn't write exactly in a list and just take some steps to get there - in fact, you might never get there - and that's extremely motivating ♡ !!!<br>
comparing yourself to other girls looking at them as inspirations and looking at their achievements as motivation is something that always makes me feel very happy and inspired to be a better girl as well. to be a better person. i feel extremely motivated when i meet a girl who has life goals similar to mine ( things like being a purer, gentler, wiser person ) and on the same level that i feel that i don't want to lose to her, i don't want to be behind her, i want to reach her !! just as i want to be free to follow my own path, not hers ; i want to be just as a good girl as she is, not to be exactly like her. i want to be myself, the best i can be. seeing other girls being the best they can be fills my heart with joy and i definitely consider them rivals ! i want them to get better every day, just like me ♡ !!<br>
the rivalry between girls is something wonderful and incredible, not for compare us objectively, but subjectively.<br>
<br>
do you fluffies agree on what i wrote ?<br>
please, give me your opinions and additions ♡ !<br>
i wish you all the most beautiful and peaceful xmas !!!<br>

i feel absolutely soft these days ~<br>
i have learned a lot about patience and self control, but mostly about self care !<br>
i'm pretty anxious when it comes to being productive, i'd say i'm almost addicted to that sense of accomplishment after having a busy day.<br>
the problem is that i always felt useless when i was in my spare time ; ;<br>
this is not healthy, so i'm trying my best to respect the free hours of my day as much as the working hours, after all, both are important <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ayl9a7S.gif"/><br>
i'm also feeling that i'm getting more and more free of the "physical" things... even though they really matter to me, i know that too much bonding to them emotionally makes me feel needy easily, which is not good at all !<br>
it is definitely essential to remember that the most important things are not physical, because naturally, what makes us feel like home is where our heart is, not our body <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YYQfh8r.gif"/><br>

<br>
today, double q&a !<br>
first subject is about trauma coping issues, second one about virtual world issues.<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ణ ⅰ<br>
this subject is very specific but i feel i should express myself about it, since i see many people with weird and even disgusting kinks, aesthetics or artistic expressions, justifying it as a way of "coping trauma". i don't particularly think it's completely wrong, but very controversial and dangerous.<br>
i follow some trauma blogs and i see many toxic people in this environment, as well as people who are harmed or treated bad for posting controversial stuff.<br>
any kind of trauma or sensitivity to some bad, disgusting, dangerous, ugly subjects in general can become an obstacle in people's lives. no one wants to feel dirty or bad. it is natural trying to deal with such experiences or thoughts ; trying to romanticize, normalize, or even sexualizate. we want to see beauty and pleasure in ugly things so we don't feel rejection for them and for ourselves and our bad memories, but obviously we need to take responsibility for this type of action and specify the motives, inform people of the problems and risks and not treat as something cute and casual. it's not the kind of content you have the right to post anywhere or spread around the world, no matter how traumatized you are. you have NO RIGHT to bother other people with your confused and romanticized content.<br>
people usually deal with this sort of thing in the form of art, aesthetics and even kinks, there are people who do ugly romanticized things to become their aesthetic and way of life as a way of coping with trauma. this is something natural and there is usually no intention to hurt someone, just to make things simpler ; the problem is that this kind of attitude should not be treated as something simple. people who do this kind of art, people who post on this kind of aesthetics, people who live such lives should not spread to the world what they do as if it were something beautiful and desirable. this type of content, which has "damaged innocence", are something very sensitive, that i support, because they have already helped me a lot, but within specific communities and treated properly, as something very delicate and dangerous.<br>
if you're not aware of what you're doing you can put yourself in danger situations intentionally to try to confront your fears and this is not at all healthy or acceptable, depending on your condition. this is one side where self diagnosis can be dangerous because you really can't handle extreme things in an extreme way without having proper help, but i've already written about that subject. i've also commented about how kinks being treated as a cute and cool "aesthetic" and spread over the internet is a bad thing for influencing young people and being harmful to other people.<br>
when i say that these processes of romanticizing helped me, it is true, it helped me a lot at a time that i was feeling very insecure and dirty because of my sometimes weird, dangerous and controversial desires. i was embarrassed to talk to anyone about it and this kind of romanticized content helped me a lot to understand that i was not a bad person by feeling what i felt, but more importantly, i was educated to know that even though it was "normal" it was not necessarily a right thing to do, or something to be proud of. so it has always been a secret and helped me to mature. over time, i could better understand what i felt and separate harmful things from healthy ones, and so be able to have a better lifestyle ( please don't ask me details about it, it makes me very uncomfortable /// ). it would be extremely hypocritical if i said that romanticizing is always bad, i just think that caution and instructions for such content are fundamental, to prevent this from being a bad influence and worsen people's mental health.<br>
i don't think people really need to have gone through physical traumas to have the "right to coping", that's a very disrespectful opinion ; everyone has the right to overcome their fears and problems, the problem is that when you do it publicly and treat it as something soft and romantic, such as a "broken doll" or "fallen angel", other people are harmed because they will put themselves in danger intentionally and consequently end up traumatized as well.<br>
finally, again, i confirm that i don't think it's wrong to romanticize things or even sexualize them if it makes you feel better, but it is something extremely personal and delicate that must be done with caution and with the notion that suffering is not nice. it may be poetically beautiful, interesting, but it's not something that anyone should desire as it's dangerous and harmful.<br>
and anyway, i think it's good to consult professional help to know if you are coping in a healthy way because each person has particularities when dealing with this type of thing ! please stay safe ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　ణ ⅱ<br>
as you know, i am very involved with the "virtual world". the internet is part of my life and many of my works are digital. even so, i highly value the caution in creating a "virtual identity" just as i think it's sorely primordial to avoid spending too much time on the internet and overvalue the virtual world.<br>
i learned over time that the virtual world may seem "perfect" and incredible, just as it very easily occupies our time ( often not free time ) and entertains us ; but it's also very limited, so it is not worth replacing your "real life" time.<br>
the internet can be very useful for learning new things, interacting with people from all over the world, personal improving, and even for sorts of important jobs and hobbies, which is why i love the internet and value it. but the internet can only stimulate our sight and hearing, and we have five senses. only real life can stimulate all five senses and bring us full life experiences full of sensations and feelings !!<br>
you can't eat freshly picked wild berries, you can't feel the scent of flowers, you can't pet a fluffy animal, you can't hug people you love over the internet. don't substitute your real time for the virtual, it's not worth it. the internet has many limitations, it is inferior in comparison.<br>
and just as all experiences are much more intense and wonderful in real life, you too can only be as perfect and better as possible in real life. the virtual identity that we create exists to allow us to introduce others who are far from us, we can put together the best visuals we can offer and we can also publish works and receive reviews and feedback, we can learn and improve ; but you really are much more special with all the details. your image and voice are not all you have to offer, you in real life are a complete person and if you focus on improving yourself as a whole and not only superficially, you can enjoy the virtual world and the world real in the best way possible : beneficial, fun and above all, healthy ♡ !<br>
<br>
these are subjects that i always see people having confused feelings about, and that also confused me a lot for several years ; ;<br>
it's the kind of thing that gets in the way of our personal development, so i really hope that my texts are useful to you in some way ///<br>
