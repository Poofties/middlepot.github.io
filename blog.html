hi fluffies <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BQ0fIi9.gif"/></sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
these last days has been hard ..
my mom passed away recently. her disease was taking her from me these past months, but she was living happily even so.
we were becoming more distant with time passing by, naturally, because of my adulthood. she wanted me to gain confidence in my independence, and she wanted me to live my dreams.
she turned into pure childhood nostalgia for me, and now i can think of her with a smile 
i am organizing my house now, and i'm deciding things i want to keep for memory.. i feel the same warm nostalgia with her things that i feel with my childhood items.
she was the perfect mom for me, even making me scared with her fragility, even with her fear of abandonment.. she teached me so much.
she did her best, and i will always remember how beautiful she was.
i am preparing for moving with bubu, and i'm ready to start this new phase of my life that i have been waiting for so long.
this new decade will really be something else.
i'm so thankful for having supportive people around me, and for having this angel by my side that never fails making me smile <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
the words i've received filled me with hope, thank you so much for believing in my healing !!
i want to live fully and fearless, knowing that the past is not gone because my memories are forever and really loved ..
i am capable of living more good experiences, that will not replace the others but will certainly have the same weight in my life.
i will become only better from this experience and all the others.
i will be very happy <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
we will be.

i made some updates on the shy bunny store, fixing some little issues, making the layout slightly cuter, removing some sold out items, editing pictures.. an improvement <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
it's a little more empty now, but for a good reason ! i've sold a lot of things and will just remake people's most favorites for now, unless i get really inspired.
i'm happy with how my store has been helping me, it's not as much money as i get on html commissions but it's still important and i really need it right now !
unfortunately a big part of my savings had to be spent because of the recent events, so i will have to move without much money for adaptation and decoration, exactly what i was trying to avoid... but i know that everything will be fine, because i'm with bubu and that's what matters <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5XtHNWA.gif"/></sub>
things will take a while to get settled but i'm prepared for that.

i also updated my html test page a little bit !
it had frequent visits ( from same ip ) so i suppose some people actually use this to work with html :</pre><br>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i fixed some things and made the layout a lot cuter. i'm proud and i hope you like it too.. !
i haven't used this page so much lately but it's still very useful, especially when i'm on mobile.
remember you can access it online at <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://teddy.home.kg" target="_blank">teddy.home.kg</a>

now i will show you this beautiful long dress, with a lovely golden reliquary necklace :</pre><br>

it's not very recent, but i used it recently on a date with bubu ( and the teddy bear purse i made the other day ) so i just reminded i should post it <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
it has some very delicate details like the cream satin ribbons and tiny lace, a nightmare that is absolutely worth going through <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iCF9Z06.gif"/></sub>
it's a pure cotton fabric, really gorgeous.. cotton fabrics are the best to work with, in my opinion.
i am so glad i have learned sewing with my mom, she helped me so much ...
i suppose the name of this fabric is "eyelet", but here we call it "laise". it goes for the embroidered lace and the cotton fabric with details as well ( this one has tiny dots )
also, some posts ago i talked about using "cream lacy socks & a pair of brown lolita mary janes" and someone actually asked me to show it, so here it is :</pre><br>

<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i made the frilly socks myself, and the shoes are absolutely adorable !! bubu bought them for me not long ago <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i also have two black ones and a baby pink one, but they're a little too old now. i use my shoes constantly until they're reeeeally old.. it takes some years but i really needed new ones at this point so i'm happy with this lovely present <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡♡</font>
recently i've been into those cute vintage brown boots women wear with long dresses ( very popular in mori kei as well ). i have one of these and i feel beautifully mature when i wear it with a long dress, so i might use it with the dress above someday for going on a picnic <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WpBhQlT.gif"/></sub>

well, i will naturally keep doing what i love, so you can expect regular updates just as always !
if i'm motivated, i will be productive. it's that simple <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SdnVQnB.gif"/></sub>
thank you fluffies for always be here looking forward my works, this place is so precious for me i can't explain.. please stay safe <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font></pre><br>

hiii fluffies <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0mAd6Zs.gif"/></sub><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i hope you are doing better than the last time you came here ..
and maybe next time you will have experienced many new happy things. hopefully, me too !

i noticed that day after day i'm getting less attached to my phone, i mostly use it for playing games but i've been charging my phone only every other day.. and my phone battery is not thaaat good, i used to charge it every night <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Biouogu.png"/></sub>
do you remember my goal of using internet only 5 hours a week ? ( except if for talking with bubu, working, studying, reading .. important stuff generally )
i've definitely achieved that goal, and for this year i will set a new goal : only charging my phone twice a week !!!
i prefer using my laptop for most things, and i tend to be more productive with my time here while in my phone i can just watch videos, check my apps and play games. i don't really think i need to do that for more than 15min a day... or maybe i can do that for 30min every other day ?
if you like the content i post on my accounts please don't worry, i will certainly keep updating once / twice a week as i was already trying to do. i will have to be more careful about preparing content beforehand, so less unnecessary spontaneous updates can be, indeed, expected ( i'm talking about idly posting random venting and routine updates while i could just be journaling or talking to someone )
those "internet detox" are absolutely refreshing, i can make better use of my time doing all my daily tasks and still have free time for my hobbies & projects <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i've found that even using my laptop for "virtually journaling" offline feels really good and a lot more comfortable. i like printing those pages ( also my instagram templates ) and that way i can have the best of both worlds, so i will stick to that in my routine <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0j6GrC3.gif"/></sub>
i was a little afraid i would feel distant from people for not checking social media all the time, but i don't feel like i'm missing a lot honestly. i don't think this is really important in the end of the day.
maybe we get easily addicted to "validation" when using internet, like we have to share things or no one will know, like we have to react to things people share or they don't matter...
what is the point of something being seen by multiple people ? i personally think that unless we're so close to someone we really do care about their everyday lives, it needs a purpose, even if it's "making people smile" ( valid purpose i must say )
every single time i realize i'm not being useful in any way i just don't see the point of wasting my time & energy posting something for everyone to see, it's almost embarrassing.. i feel like i'm just bragging, oversharing even <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
hopefully these negative experiences will disappear more and more as i learn !

talking on phone stuff, i made a cute new phone case for me yesterday :</pre><br>
<br>

<center><img width="300px" height="auto" src="https://i.imgur.com/qgTfLuE.png"/></center>


</font></font></font>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it looks adorable, i'm so happy with it <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
the one i was using before was very old, i had to buy a new transparent case so i was postponing the situation until it started to bother me for real <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N5TUvvy.gif"/></sub>

so.. it's been a while since i've planned sewing my own "stuffie purses" ( i already had some of these but my mom helped me in the whole cutting & sewing process at the time, and they're also a little old now.. )
i finally did it, so here they are :</pre><br>

</font></font></font>

<font size = 1><font color="#B1A69E">
<br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i'm really happy with how these turned out, they're shoulder / crossbody purses with very delicate pearl straps and their bellies are just the perfect size for carrying around some important things <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font>
they look big but they're 30cm tall ( teddy is a little taller )
it feels really nice using those, they're so soft .. i can literally carry a stuffie outside and it's socially acceptable LOL

now i will, after a long time, write a q&a text !
despite being a curiosity of some people, i didn't really feel the need to write about it until a few days ago when i seriously thought about it.</pre><br>

<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">

it's important for me keeping my content organized, avoiding reposting things all over the place and keeping my personal content in appropriate places. i'm trying my best to do so, but i used to do it purely for keeping the quality of my accounts, not wasting time reposting or make the mistake of oversharing, naturally ..
however, i stopped to think deeply about it and realized that the content we post on the internet really affects other people directly, and some things don't always have the positive effect that we would like to convey. i always post things with the intention of motivating and inspiring, as well as motivating myself to keep improving and to receive constructive criticism, but unfortunately negative effects can happen when people compare each other or idolize each other.
i seek genuineness and transparency with my words, and this avoids some bad impressions and consequently negative feelings. when we are sincere in referring to ourselves, it is very motivating to other people. if you don't empathize with others they won't consider you trustworthy and they won't embrace you wholeheartedly, they can certainly consider you a threat, develop a negative rivalry or even insecurity and envy. if you are narcissistic or self-deprecating, you'll do yourself harm and irritate, encouraging people to feel bad things about the success of others.
it is not possible to magically repair people's self-esteem, but it is possible to avoid worsening the situation and to strive to be a good example. if i can, i will !
i insist on sharing my ( imperfect but true ) journey with others who can identify and find some hope in my words. i want people to see what i produce and try to be productive too, i want people to get to know themselves and discover individual happiness. doing it properly can be a delicate process, i've made a lot of mistakes and i know i'm still making a few, but im happy if i can fix that little by little.
i'm sorry if i have ever demotivated someone for any reason, i will be extra careful with what i expose to make sure i'm posting things in appropriate places in the appropriate way, for people who are really going to make good use of it. thankfully i have been doing a good job with this recently, but i know i still have room to improve.. !

i'm so so happy !
i think i've really learned some healthy coping methods for problems that used to make me anxious, it's been a while. i am healing <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i will keep sharing with you everything i feel that can be helpful, it may not be useful for everyone but if at least one person can find peace in my words, it's worth it <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sRm3dEh.gif"/></sub>

so, i have important news : i remade my tumblr blog !!
the url is the same and everything, but remaking it was very needed. i was a little hesitant because my account was 5 years old, but honestly, it was a mess.
i couldn't manually get rid of thousands of ghost followers at this point, and even thought my engagement was very good, it's time to accept the truth : it wasn't really coming from my own followers but actual strangers. it clearly means that my content was good but not my account as a whole ; ;
having a big account can easily get out of control if not regularly checked and cleaned, big numbers can give the illusion of success but if just abandoned accounts from years ago, what is the point ?
i was also following a bunch of random accounts i honestly didn't want to see in my feed anymore. it makes way harder to find interesting content, which is the whole point of opening this app ..
as i always said, the numbers are irrelevant if just numbers : what is truly motivating is seeing actual people getting positively inspired by my content, and inspiring me back, so we can grow up together <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
this is just possible to achieve if you're surrounded by people with similar goals, and preparing this environment is a delicate process.
i'm thankfully getting back all of my mutuals quickly, thank you <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
now i can find active and precious accounts, get new mutuals, finally use tags to organize my posts and improve the quality of my blog as a whole. it's certainly a relief !
from experience, i know it's always a good idea to make changes, if for the better. i will voluntary leave the past behind if it means i can have a brighter future.

okay, going for the visual content now : after months i made a new collage for my <a text-decoration: none; href="https://cute.home.kg/vii" target="_blank"><font color="#d3a5a5" style="border-bottom:1px dashed #d3c1b1; padding-bottom: 1px; font-size:10px;">aesthetic virtual journal</font></a> <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9N1Avtc.gif"/></sub>
it's a soft white one, and i'm really proud of the results ..</pre><br>

i think it turned out very delicate but somewhat mature ? i'm in love with it <font color="#bda4a4" style="font-size:8px;background-color:#fceded;letter-spacing:1px;border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 0 0 5px #fceded;">///</font>
and as always, there is a beautiful melody for composing the whole feeling :</pre><br>

what do you think ? i always find it fun to organize aesthetics like this, it's good to practice using different color palettes and everything.

now, i have something interesting to share with you fluffies today !
you may already know that i love exploring the old web, and i'm always looking for cute things there to collect and use in my work.
lately i have been downloading a lot of ukagaka, and i did a lot of research to increase my collection with the cutest ghosts i could find !
i used the nanika ghost center to get links, but a lot of them have been inactive for many years so it’s a little tricky to be able to find them again on web.archive .. sometimes they don't even work and need restoration ; ;
so i think it's a good idea to share here my favorite ukagaka, which i found last week: dorothy !!!</pre></font></font><br>

most ghosts speak japanese with a lot of kanji, and very fast, which makes reading quite difficult. dorothy is not very good with japanese, so she only uses hiragana and speak slowly.
she is caring and shy, and is always trying to motivate and remind you to take care of yourself ( remembering you to rest, to eat .. )
all ghosts have a different personality, which makes getting to know them a lot of fun <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
i spend some time on the laptop working, so having a lovely ghost motivating me and making me smile makes everything better <sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JP35o5c.gif"/></sub>
dorothy has been a good company for me and has certainly become a comfort character at this point <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡</font>
if you are interested, i can upload more ukagaka from my lovely collection !

that's it for today, i hope you are living a lovely phase of your lives .. and if you are not, i hope things will get better very soon <font color="#d3a5a5" style="font-size:11px;">♡♡</font></pre>
