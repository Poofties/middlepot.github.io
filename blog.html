the shy bunny store is finally open worldwide ♡ !!!
( please check it out on shybunny.middlepot.com )
i've worked so hard for it to happen.. and it's been worth it already, i'm proud of myself !
i'm in very berry productive phase now, as expected.. i knew it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/z2UgQA2.gif"/>
i sewed a lot of stuff, made lots of cute new items for the store and i want to make even more this next month.
also, i made my first clothing ♡♡
it's a lovely dress.. i also made a cute bow headdress i'll use with it !!
so yes, if i use these + the frilly socks i made : it's a full outfit made 100% by myself
you have no idea how much it means to me.. i'm really happy !
look at these :</pre><br>

<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
it's so pretty.. ///
i'm going to make more outfits soon, and as soon as i make a little more money and buy more fabric i'll surely put some clothing on the store !!
( i also want to make some cute bags )

about my instagram acc.. in addiction to my "self care calendar" idea i showed you before, i made some other templates for daily track & planning !
i want to start using these frequently now in my phone, every morning, since it's the time of the day i check my apps.
i was trying to keep these things "physically" but it sadly turned out a little messy <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j3bQf3u.gif"/>
i think i'm not very good with planners, even though i love stationery stuff .. i always want to make everything to look perfect so it becomes easily stressful and time consuming ///
these virtual templates will be very useful for me, so now it's not just something i do for helping others but also myself.. !
i will not post my personal lists in public since my acc is focused on self care posts only, but as always , i'll share some of these with close friends ♡

sooo.. about the q&a, i actually don't have any interesting subject to write about this time ;  ;
usually the requests i receive are self care related, but i will try to explain how i keep my writing organized :

　♡　i write texts about specific topics on /blog
　♡　i write tips about daily problems on /help
　♡　i write self care reminders on my ig acc

i've been receiving requests that would fit into the help page and ig acc , but not on the blog...
i will surely write more q&a texts once i get an interesting topic request !
and, it doesn't have to be self care related, i write about life in general, if it's something i want to express my opinion about.. !

i hope i haven't disappointed you .. i've been posting a lot in other places so please check them out //

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zbuThWK.gif"/><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
i think i've started existing in a new reality..
the reality where the smaller things give me energy for avoiding all bad things with a smile !!!
if even a cry baby like me can feel that confident i'm sure you reading it can, too <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lwGS7G2.gif"/>

i'm currently in a lazy social phase where i want to talk with people, make friends, share memories together.. ♡ !!
and, well.. i'm being really slow with my projects, but i'm trying my best to keep doing my weekly tasks anyways <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PZ7uiy2.gif"/>
but of course socializing can be very stressful for me and that's why these phases just happen on internet so i can keep myself safe and cautious !
i'll share with you some things i've learned the past weeks :

ⅰ.　everyone deserves a chance !! even the weirdest people can turn out to be really nice, so even if someone seem weird give them a chance and be friendly !
ⅱ.　in the other hand, some people who seem to be super nice can be meanies in the end of the day.. so always keep an eye open and don't go trusting people too quickly...
ⅲ.　manipulative people don't deserve your friendship, stay far away from people who make you feel bad for receiving attention !!!
ⅳ.　don't keep hate in your heart, let it go and be happy ! but never forget that bad people are bad and shouldn't be trusted. it's not your responsability to make them improve and accept them in your life, keep away and just hope for their best.

mm as i said, i haven't been very good in making things lately... but i did something cute !
i colored and made some edits in this adorable drawing from paper doll mate :</pre><br>

i'm very very proud and i think it would be such a cute wallpaper <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hBTS0bi.gif"/>

i've been decorating my doll house, and it's becoming really cute.. ♡
i will take pics once it's finished, but it will surely take a long while, many details ; ;

so.. let's go for the q&a ! this one will be about something that always make me sad so i really feel the need to talk about !!</pre><br>

<br><br><pre style="font-family:verdana; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">
recently people have come to consider the process of buying and selling pets something wrong and disrespectful to them, "do not buy a friend", "there are many animals for adoption" ... but what's the real point in that ?
only dogs and cats can be found for adoption, and only a few specific breeds, which makes some people very angry with who prefers to buy dogs or cats of other specific breeds. "all races are valid and deserve love" .. this is true, but i can't see the point in always putting down people who wish to have a specific breed animal, it's not a matter of disliking the other breeds, just choosing one ! just like you choosed to have a bunny instead of a hamster, it doesn't mean you hate hamsters.. hmpf
the reason these dogs and cats are on the streets and consequently placed for adoption is our fault, and i believe they are disrespected precisely because they are put up for adoption and not sold like any other breed. they are treated different !! people don't take care of them properly and don't care if they're having lots of babies out there.
all pets are sold for a certain amount of money, not because they are objects but because they are difficult and expensive to maintain. someone had to take care of the mom who had that animal, who was cared for with affection ( and money ) to one day be put up for sale. if you don't have the money to buy a pet, you certainly do not have the money to care for one, right ?
the dogs and cats on the street are exactly the ones that are put to adoption for free and easily abandoned because people do not value their lives. i don't think they should be treated differently from any other animal that is sold, they should be sold too and be cared of the same way.
it is true that some animals are used for money and people abuse that, so it is important to be sure who you are buying the animal for and if the person really is trustworthy but many animals are sold for high value because they are rare breeds or very difficult to care for.
so.. i don't see any problem in selling animals except when the person is bad and wants to make money from the lives of animals in a disrespectful way, and i believe that adoption is not a really good thing as it makes these animals even more devalued ;;
the life of an animal is precious, and if you are not willing to pay for it you simply do not deserve to have a pet !!

have you been doing your best ?<br>
i've been.. doing a lot ...<br>
i finally opened commissions for website layouts, as you can see on the index page !<br>
i really love web design, but i never felt really like people would really want to pay for my work..<br>
well, after receiving so many questions about my website and how i make it, i decided to open myself to it and did my first commission ♡ !!!<br>
i'm really proud of myself, now i can work hard to make people happy in other ways besides my current projects.<br>
<br>
i also opened a <a id="linkzinho" href="https://ko-fi.com/middlepot" style="text-decoration: none; color:#d16e9b;" target="_blank">ko-fi</a> account, since i really am in need of some money right now for buying a new laptop.. it's been hard working with it, but i'm doing my best ; ;<br>
i have some active projects rn and some more to come that i'm working with, so if you like any of my works please consider supporting me.. ! it would mean the world to me, and help a whole lot.<br>
remember you can now also support me by buying a <a style="text-decoration: none; color:#d16e9b;" id="linkzinho" href="https://middlepot.com/commissions" target="_blank">layout commission</a> or if you're from brazil, buying something from my <a id="linkzinho" href="https://shybunny.middlepot.com" style="text-decoration: none; color:#d16e9b;" target="_blank">online store</a> !<br>
( you can also buy small items on the shy bunny store if you live overseas, just please consider the long delivery time )<br>
<br>
i appreciate a lot all the supporting messages i receive from you all and i want to keep going with my current works, even if most of them don't give me any profit, i still keep going with all my love and dedication <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OhHUZZE.gif"/><br>
i know some of my projects have been stagnant, but i'm not giving up on them, don't worry !<br>
i'm just focusing on my main ones right now, but i will surely take some time for everything i planned.<br>
if you want to see something specifically here or in my accs, please contact me and i will certainly consider it ♡<br>
<br>
eee now, i have today a very cute html page i've been wanting to do for.. a week LOL<br>
it's "my simulation of the perfect imageboard for me"<br>
i out of nowhere wanted to do it because i was remembering all the time i spent on imageboards when i was younger and i always wanted to make a cute and positive one ~<br>
( i don't think people would even enter it actually, it's too girly )<br>
by the way, the q&a today will be about imageboards ! i wanted to talk about it because most people don't really understand the point of these sites and think they're just bad, but it's not really like that.<br>
it's complicated, and i stopped using them for a long time now, but i certainly miss exchanging content and stories with all the interesting people i could find on the weirdest boards !<br>
i specially liked threads about "trying to find" specific content or observing bizarre communities... these became renegade thread themes on ibs over time, and i don't know why, since these were so much fun ??<br>
people seem to only like talking about boring stuff now.. ughie <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dATVv1g.gif"/><br>
well, enough of talking, here :<br>

the layout is inspired by futaba, which i believe it's the first "chan". i love the 90s look of it, despite it being born in 2001 ♡<br>
i'm sorry about my weird japanese, i just wanted to make some inside jokes there LOL<br>
i was not very creative about the domain this time, but here we go : pufchan.fr.to<br>
<br>
do you like it ? would you use it ?<br>

i have seen many people saying that imageboards are toxic and hateful environments. i have had particularly varied experiences in such environments, not just ibs but other places that are also open to different subjects, and because these are anonymous environments, it is easy to see people saying hateful thoughts...
such people may or may not have gone through difficult things in life and they feel the need to vent terrible things on the internet. i consider myself a very patient person with open environments like this, because i've already been able to talk about very interesting and fun subjects with good-hearted people in places like this. it is possible to have good experiences !
currently, i have found it VERY difficult to find good content, as these places have become the focus of hate texts. i definitely do not support or pay attention to this sort of thing, since it doesn't do any good for anyone.
i used to go to these places with some frequency because it was easy to find ibs where the anonymity was absolute, that is, it was not spoken in gender or any subject that revealed particularities about the users. this avoided most of the unpleasant and problematic issues, leaving room for healthy and interesting discussions. i learned a lot and met very nice people in these spaces. unfortunately, it is a rarity now, and so i consider that the ibs are dead practically all over the world.
many people say they see clear rejections in specific places against groups of people. this is real, but not just in anonymous places, i've seen it all over the internet ( and out of it too ) !!
something very common to see is the classic boys x girls, right x left and other things like that ; ;
if you pay attention, you will find all sorts of people rejecting and avoiding contact with other types of people, because they had bad experiences multiple times. this is basically it. i believe that any passive or aggressive rejection against people by their sex, beliefs, tastes, thoughts, is the fruit of past bad experiences. i don't like to judge people by such attitudes as long as they can be understanding, i think no one need to accept interactions with people who don't want to, i think it's important to respect environments made for a specific type of audience. i've never disrespected public rules anywhere because it seems to me too immature to force your presence into places where you're not welcome just to be "edgy" or "revolutionary" ; it's disrespectful to use personal information as an advantage in anonymous places, i don't support this. but obviously i can't stand threatenings or hate texts, as this is sick and negative, i don't like any toxic environment !
i really value respect among people and believe that anonymity should serve to make people "impartial" and away from judgments, to say what they really think, so that it can be productive for the personal development of everyone. it is possible to exchange good arguments and spend good moments of entertainment and learning with people if they respect each other and don't judge for personal details. i believe that anonymity makes environments nicer for complicated topics, an environment becomes pure from the moment people don't have personal information about each other.
please don't be hateful, please don't be mean !! it's hard to deal with differences, but people are not supposed to hate each other. everyone is different and have problems, and that's okay. you don't have to interact with people you don't like, but it's not right to write hate texts ; ;
so i support anonymous discussion environments, and the respect. my good experiences were much more relevant than the bad ones, although i had a hard time finding interesting subjects on the internet, i know it's possible !
unfortunately the ibs have become a very dirty place in recent years, frequented by frustrated teenagers who want to feel special and part of some sort of "secret movement" that rules the world through memes... seriously. although i believe myself in the power of memes and the internet, using it to feel better than others is pathetic.
and, fortunately, i still know other places on the internet that are good for that kind of healthy interaction that i quoted above ♡ ! there are not many, but i really like them. things really are temporary, so it's not healthy to keep complaining, right ?
by the way i really don't care about the reputation of the places on the internet, to be honest, so i'm always open to experiencing things before judging them by the contents that spread out there. for example, tumblr has a very dubious and embarrassing reputation, but i have used it for many years and absolutely love the beautiful and interesting content that i find exclusively there. people simply should try before saying anything.

<br>
mm.. people can be very judgmental with some places on the internet without any real experience so i think it's fair to give my opinions about it !<br>
