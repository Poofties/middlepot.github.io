hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QwgXhbN.gif"/><br>
i would like to thank once again the support you give me, it is really very special for me !!<br>
the ideas you give me are very useful and i never tire of saying thank you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3ubYtGu.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4xWUuUR.gif"/><br>
because of my routine post yesterday i received some messages thanking the inspiration for organization and productivity, but i also received some rather sad messages saying that they couldn't be productive or follow schedules like me.<br>
i would like to clarify that although schedules are important, it is not always possible to follow them.<br>
sometimes i go to sleep later than i intended, sometimes i wake up with a headache, i don't force myself to go beyond my limits <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrqO7A4.gif"/><br>
everyone has different limits, you don't have to do multiple tasks every day, you don't have to wake up at 6:30 am, it's different for every person !<br>
your routine should be tailored to your lifestyle and your chores and hobbies should be things that you feel good doing, and i didn't include household chores in the routine because they vary according to need, but i have these as well, every day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTuY6k2.gif"/><br>
it's important to be productive but it's also important to stay healthy and happy, never forget <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qjiy032.gif"/><br>
<br>
soooooo, i'm super happy these days because tomorrow, day 5, me and bubu have completed 5 years of dating ♡ !!!!<br>
we're going to take a little trip together and i'm super extremely excited and i dream about it every day !!<br>
i love him so so so so so much <img src="https://i.imgur.com/g5pvtoc.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ANrPV0v.gif"/><br>
<br>
today i'm going to finally show you something that you asked me since the videos on my phone, i'll show you a little bit of my notebook :<br>

next time i want to record something in portuguese, i think it would be interesting.<br>
what do you think ?<br>
<br>
so /// because of yesterday's very personal post with information about my personality, some people asked me to post some things about my body as well. i thought a lot about it because it's very intimate and i don't like to post so many things like that ...<br>
but i decided that i'll post, since these are information that anyone who knows me personally would know, there is nothing so secret about it.<br>
i'll add these in the faq :<br>
<br>
✂　my height is 5,5. average, i guess ?<br>
✂　i weight 117 lbs. i think i'm skinny, but not super skinny, i'm okay.<br>
✂　i don't want to share measurements here, but i really like my body shape ! according to my measures, i'm hourglass figure.<br>
✂　my skin is pale, but not super pale. i hate tanning because my skin is really sensitive and turns red only ; ;<br>
✂　my hair changes color very much according to the lighting, but it also becomes clearer if i go out in the sun. it's dark blond / light brown and sometimes it gets a little bit orange, but it's only noticeable in the sunlight.<br>
✂　i like to keep a "himecut" in my hair, with short side bangs ( it's cute but also a bit more mature than straight bangs ). i cut my hair myself. i'm lazy so it's common for my bangs to be super long + my hair is quite wavy, so the cut is not so noticeable.<br>
✂　my eyes are between blue and green ( cyan, turquoise ) + a little bit grayish.<br>
✂　i don't know my shoe size to be honest, but my feet are 24cm.<br>
✂　um... i'm a-cup ;////;<br>
<br>
... of course i would not leave the post with just that, it would be shameful.<br>
i have something much more important to post on today's q&a, super very extremely important :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i would like to talk about these two adjectives that are so confusing to people : pure & innocent.<br>
these are actually extremely important things, but are treated as something far, almost impossible to achieve. and that's not true, because it's something we can all go back to.<br>
to explain it better, let's define purity and innocence :<br>
purity, as i have already commented in other posts, is something that you are when you're being yourself. when you act naturally and follow your heart, when you do not listen to what others think is good for you, but what your heart says is best for you. your heart wants you to have a clear conscience, want you to stay safe and healthy, wants you to be happy. it's not always the easiest path, but it's always the right one, the pure one. purity is literally not be contaminated by external influences. it's hard because we live in society and we need to please others, but it doesn't mean that you need to change who you are ( not even a little bit ) to be a nice person, and be happy.<br>
innocence is something that people often confuse with ignorance. when you don't know things by choice, you are being ignorant, which is a bad quality. innocence is when you see the world in a beautiful way, when you believe in your dreams, believe things can get better, do not judge others before you know, when even after being bitten by a dog, do not you think all dogs are evil. so, innocence is more linked to positivity, it's a quality of being radiant and full of love, even having gone through difficult things, or not. of course it's easier to be positive when you don't have traumas to deal with, but that's not the point. it is possible, and it is necessary for you to be happy !<br>
children are pure and innocent because they have not been "contaminated" by society's pressure to be different from who they really are, to give up their dreams, to think the world and people are bad and it's always getting worse. this is not right and it's not true. it's a super toxic thought.<br>
other ( nonhuman ) animals are like children forever, for at least none of them still live in society like humans. society itself is not a problem, but people just don't have the maturity to deal with it in a healthy way. it's something that people should educate themselves and educate their children so that we can all be happier !!<br>
never think that you have no hope, that you are dirty or rotten, that your dreams can't come true, that magic doesn't exist. erase it forever from your life !!! learning to evaluating your behavior and the way you see the world is very important to becoming a better and more satisfied person. believe in your dreams, make the little you from the past proud of who you became today ♡ !<br>
<br>
i really hope it touched your heart !<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FImDn9i.gif"/><br>
aaaa //// i'm so thankful for the cute messages i've received lately !!<br>
you all are so kind to me, i don't deserve it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OT3hgIG.gif"/><br>
also, i love it when you send me suggestions. i like to post things you want to see !<br>
<br>
um, so, do you remember that i was training to be ambidextrous ?<br>
i think i can consider that i already got there !!<br>
i really can't believe how fast that was, i thought it would take a long time <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2fh66l4.gif"/><br>
i am training every day using my left hand to do day-to-day tasks, and to write.<br>
i'd say i can do things 80% the same way with my left hand now !<br>
and i can write with the same handwriting, but it's a bit slower ( i never can write too fast anyway )<br>
well, i am very proud of the progress ♡ !!<br>
<br>
today the post will be a little more personal, since you have been asking for some little things ///<br>
these days i was writing down my routine, as usual. i usually write down daily task lists, but i always had some items that i repeated every day.<br>
for ease, i wrote down these items in a txt, which i kept for a while. it was not very cute, so i thought i should write it somewhere else ...<br>
i was in the mood to do some pretty cute html page, so i did one with some things from my routine !!<br>
it was quite spontaneous, i was not even going to show it to anyone at first.<br>
but as you asked for some more personal things like that, and it was so cute, i decided to post !<br>
and with a super cute url ( comfy.softcoffee.ro ), of course <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2DYo6uh.gif"/><br>
i will leave here a backup file, as always :<br>

well.. like i said, i can record reading stories, fairytales .. i like this kind of content and it's a little hard to find, so i'll try hard to do it, if you want, of course ; ;<br>
( please do not ask me to record more singing cause this is too much for me LOL )<br>
<br>
because of the other post where i say that i don't like people to "guess" my personality through tests, astrology, blood type or anything, you asked me to post things about my personality.<br>
i'm actually quite honored that you really care about me that way, it's very sweet <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WatUq79.gif"/><br>
i thought about it for a while, i don't really like to talk about myself so deeply, but since this is a more personal post... here it is :<br>
<br><br>

　　　　　𝓅𝓮𝓇𝓈𝓸𝓃𝒶𝓁𝒾𝓉𝓎 𝓉𝓇𝒶𝒾𝓉𝓈 :<br>
<br>
❀　i'm very shy & introverted. so, because of my introversion, i don't feel bad for being shy, it's just part of me ;<br>
❀　i'm full of love and i do my best to take care of others and myself. i want to bring comfort and safety to everyone !<br>
❀　i have difficulties in approaching and sometimes i never feel comfortable near some people ;<br>
❀　when i'm comfortable with people, i talk a lot about random things, sometimes i even talk too much ///<br>
❀　i usually adapt to different situations and different people "changing moods", sometimes i get into it a lot and i feel confused, but i'm always myself ;<br>
❀　i'm always evaluating my behavior to improve myself, but sometimes i take it too seriously and get overwhelmed ;<br>
❀　i love rules ! i love to make rules for myself, to have rules made for me and to follow them. rules often make me happy because they make me a better person ;<br>
❀　i make lists all the time to be able to have an organized routine and take time to practice all my hobbies. feeling busy with things that i like makes me feel pretty satisfied !<br>
❀　i think too much about everything and sometimes i feel melancholic ;<br>
❀　i deeply value the purity. for me purity is directly linked to your true personality, who you really are. i never forget who i am and what i believed and wanted from myself when i was a child and i want more than anything to be proud of myself, the child i will always be.<br>
<br>
　　　　　𝓮𝓍𝓉𝓇𝒶 :<br>
<br>
❀　my sense of humor is quite childish, so i laugh at really silly things ;<br>
❀　i cry a lot, sad and happy ;<br>
❀　my main interest is beautiful things and to make things beautiful ;<br>
❀　i like everything that warms my heart and i try to fill my life with these things ;<br>
❀　people say i smell like vanilla. i think i smell like honey ///<br>
❀　i love animals, especially babies, i love taking care of babies ♡ !!!<br>
❀　i love nature, she is everything to me, i struggle daily to feel part of her and understand my instincts and role in life. this has made me extremely happy and helps me overcome any personal problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
.. that's it ///<br>

i've been embroidering a lot lately, but these are the first ones and are more special to show you for now.<br>
<br>
and i also want to do something really nice that was asked me a few times : show you my phone and how it's decorated !<br>
i'll show you my phone theme and also my line, with the two themes i have so far <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PPUtdFo.gif"/><br>
i really like the idea, since i have not posted any kind of video here so far, these will be the first ones.<br>

even though my phone is really old now, i think it's really cute !! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/a3LyqhZ.gif"/><br>
but when i have a new one, i'm going to make it even cuter and show you.<br>
about the video style, you know i could simply record the screen, but apps to record don't work well on my phone ( which is pretty old, as i said )<br>
ah, and please don't ask me to add on line, because it's extremely personal ////<br>
<br>
for today's q&a the subject will be very... heavy.<br>
i don't know if it's appropriate for you if you're a minor, but i would say that it is something very important and needs to be talked about. i'll be careful !
<br><br>
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
the sexualization is a very controversial subject. it can be seen as horrible, beautiful, okay, or even as an art form. it can be beautiful, but it can also be dangerous. there is a fine line between healthy and unhealthy sexuality, which causes people to be often completely in favor or against. i think there are big limits to it.<br>
sexual content and pornography is very dangerous because often this industry involves people being harmed and abused, and make sex seem vulgar and casual. this becomes an addiction and is totally wrong, it ruins you, makes you have a lot of problems and mess up your whole life !!<br>
this goes a long way from kinks and different forms of sexuality, it's about self-respect, safety, happiness, purity and health.<br>
i personally consider that people who are involved with pornography and prostitution ( even on the internet ) are often source of many problems, for themselves and for many others ( even children ) and i totally do not support this industry. i am not exactly against drawings and animations, for they are not real people ( when it comes especially to art, i support quite as well as artistic nudity in any case ). but, this type of content still has moral limits and should be reserved for adults, always.<br>
puberty is the time when we should be very careful about sexuality, because it is not the moment to do it, but it's natural to be curious and very important to be educated about it. repressed sexuality is often degenerate. many children at puberty become hypersexualized and even not having sex, come very close to it several times and with several different people. they can often develop weird kinks and even support pedophilia. they get hurt and traumatized for a lifetime, even hurting other people in the process.<br>
<br>
the excessive sexualization can bring hypersexualization to people, which is very dangerous for their lives.<br>
the sex itself is not impure, since we're animals and it's healthy and natural to have sexuality.<br>
but sex is not only for having babies but also for pleasure. this is when it gets dangerous.<br>
using food as an example : there are delicious foods that are healthy and some that are bad for our bodies and even if food is essential for our survival, consuming too much food can destroy our lives. everything has limits.<br>
hypersexuality can lead to need for casual sex, and it is always a problem because the more you do, the more you want to do. this in addition to being able to bring diseases, is dangerous, not healthy and bad for your mind.<br>
this is a major problem of early sexuality, since children do not have a safe way to have sex. it's always wrong, harmful and traumatic for them.<br>
it's very super important that sexuality be brought in a healthy way to make everyone happy. treating it as wrong and dirty does not help in this process !!<br>
the right sex would be not necessarily to make babies, but the one we do healthfully often and only with people we trust. the sex with whom we love is infinitely better and makes you and the other person happy. it doesn't hurt anyone, it doesn't make you sad, it's pure, safe and comfortable. makes you feel loved. there is no way to be something bad !<br>
<br>
so take care of yourselves, please, it will do miracles to your mental health. i promise.<br>
i really hope my words are easy to understand !<br>
