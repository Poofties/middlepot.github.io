hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jx8mKKt.gif"/><br>
what are you thinking of the new layout ♡ ?<br>
this one is my favorite layout of all times.. i'm so proud ; ;<br>
i organized everything waaay better, getting rid of some unnecessary pages with repetitive content.. !<br>
now i just have my main project featured, all of my other works can be found here at the blog and the portfolio.<br>
i feel like everything is way better now <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2qFl7Lb.gif"/><br>
<br>
so.. about my new social media i was starting to get.. well, too into it.<br>
but i know that social media are bad, it was making me feel really stressed already ; ;<br>
so i made a promise to myself : i will just open my apps once a day. i still want to keep my "5 hours of internet per week" but it obviously gets harder if i keep my apps open and distracting me !!<br>
this is what i'm doing now :<br>
after waking up i open the apps, i check and respond my friends, i post ( if i have something to post ), then i close the apps.<br>
sometimes i don't respond messages, if i'm tired.. and i try to plan my posts once a week, not every day ( but sometimes i'm just full of ideas )<br>
.. before sleep i like to respond the messages i haven't before, but that's about it !<br>
i'm doing it for some days now and i'm already feeling better <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NcqSAci.gif"/><br>
please be careful about social media ! it is good for making friends and reaching people with your work, but in balance. posting personal things and opening all your apps multiple times a day will only keep you increasingly far from individuality !!!<br>
you must have realized that you start thinking bad things that you would not normally think and feeling "out of place" ; it's because you're being influenced by excessive information.. !<br>
really dangerous ...<br>
<br>
talking about social media, last month i made a "mood calendar" for instagram, but this month i wasn't feeling motivated for that ..<br>
i see many similar calendars everywhere and i didn't see a reason in doing something repetitive like that, but i wanted to continue with that idea, improving it somehow.. !<br>
so i had the idea to do a "self care calendar", much more complete and useful ♡ !!<br>
i'm very proud of it and i hope to have more ideas in the future to continue helping others on a daily basis.<br>
helping people is something i love, because it not just fills my heart with joy but also makes me emotionally stronger !<br>
i feel that i can help myself and people i love better if i've practice beforehand. my own advices and texts help me a lot, and i'm really glad to be able to share it with others and help in any way ♡<br>
<br>
i have been trying to fight against insecurity for the longest time.. just like everyone else.<br>
i think that discovering your individuality is the best way for understanding who you are, what are your flatters and what you can actually improve !<br>
accepting compliments with your heart is very hard, since you don't actually believe these. it doesn't mean they're wrong.<br>
lately i've been feeling particularly insecure about myself because sometime it seems that my personality is just the way it is because of the people i've met, which would mean that i also can change others .. isn't it impure ? wrong ?<br>
actually, i think that it's a natural process of maturing. since we really are shaped with time, it doesn't mean all of it is impurity.. !<br>
i'll write more about it on the q&a today.<br>
<br>
now, the first thing i have to post here is the backup of my last html pages i made !!<br>
it's just a simple scenary collage with all of my favorite sprites of ragnarok online <img src="https://i.imgur.com/d3P2KyD.gif"/><br>
aaand, of course, cute domain : <a id="linkbjinho" href="https://kafra.ro.lt" target="_blank">kafra.ro.lt</a><br>
( i've always admired the kafras, they are inspiration to me /// )<br>
i made sprites of myself in all themes.. this is my fav one :<br>

i have also been making lots of things lately !!<br>
i decorated my little "sewing workspace", since now i have a new and super cute sewing machine ♡<br>
i'm a little tired now.. and i wanted to make more items for the shy bunny store ; ;<br>
but well, it's important to rest ! i'll make many cute stuff when i feel motivated again !!!<br>
from the latest things i made, this needle felted bear is my favorite :<br>

mm i have some important things for the q&a today, about ego and age differences !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　✁ ⅰ<br>
the ego is all that you were not naturally, all that you have consumed and learned from life experiences. the ego is not necessarily bad, but it is definitely dangerous..<br>
your ego is the cause of all your insecurities and social problems ; every time you feel dissociated or afraid of other people's opinion about you is because you're trying to make your ego stronger and protect it. the thing is .. you have nothing to be afraid of !<br>
no one can actually stole who you are, even if you feel like you're similar to others in some way of trying to replicate others to become better, it's just your way of learning. it may be not the best way of improving, but it's what you have now, so it's important being patient with yourself !!<br>
everything i've learned and got inspired by others is just what made me improve and mature, it's not a bad thing. i also believe that if i am inspiring others in a good way, it's a good thing !!<br>
it would be impure if i was changing who i am, but i am in fact just polishing myself. i can feel what is artificial and what is not ; so i trust myself to get inspiration and improve with time and experiences.<br>
i realize that overcoming this fear is really important, since it's really hurtful and hard to improve if i keep feeling afraid of trying new things, changing and not being approved by others.. !<br>
i can clearly see when people are truly giving me useful and important criticism, and when they're just trying to make me sad because they're frustrated with themselves. i still feel afraid of making people feel frustrated, but it's inevitable. bad feelings are also part of life, and i feel blessed for being able to feel these things and keep learning from it !!<br>
the ego keeps making me think that i should protect my individuality and my beliefs, that if someone dislike me it's because i'm making something wrong, they're trying to make me unmotivated.. and they're getting it .<br>
this is really bad, i now can see that it's natural if i make mistakes, even if i'm not making mistakes someone will not agree with me, everyone interpret things differently. i just hope people keep growing up and learning.. and they are !<br>
individuality is not something that can be stolen, your ego may seem artificial sometimes but if you keep your purity and just do things that you want from heart, everything is okay ♡<br>
who you are is not just visuals, musical tastes, mannerisms .. you're actually really unique, since ever. no one is truly similar to you, at all ! maybe similar to your ego, but it keeps evolving anyways. it is important to be able to representate your personality through your ego, you can help others to understand themselves and feel really comfortable in your body if you learn to look and act how you think it's the best version of you. if you're not making up your ego for others but using it as a way of expressing yourself, it's healthy and valid !!<br>
embrace your actual perfection, within your abilities and reality ♡♡<br>
everyone is trying, and sometimes there will be mean people out there. you're strong enough for understanding they're just sad and immature, they don't actually care about you personally, if you did nothing wrong. your ego makes you fragile and easily offended, but you have nothing to be afraid of !<br>
these are some important reminders for you and i...<br>
everyone learns to keep their purity in different paces, so if someone can feel suddenly confused and unsatisfied with themselves by trying to copy who i am, it's not my fault .. i always try to make it clear that purity is important..<br>
i just want to be happy, and i want others to be happy too. i know that i must accept who i am and love myself to achieve happiness !<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　✃ ⅱ<br>
i will leave here a brief opinion about age differences in relationships, in general.. !<br>
i never really cared about interacting or even being friends with people older or younger than me. i believe that age is not a factor that defines whether or not a person is nice to have around ; but if the age difference is too big ( more than 5 years ) being too close becomes a problem as there are some limits and certain topics that are not appropriate to talk with people who are living a so different phase from you. if you are a relative, you have a greater freedom to talk and be an influence to that person ( or be influenced ), but when it comes to relationships i think big age differences are not very healthy normally .. it is uncomfortable when someone's is too young or too old to even understand what you're going through right now, and some people can be really toxic : bad advices, unmotivational comments, generalizations...<br>
i've always been and i will always be open to being friendly and being there for all the lovely people who come into my life, regardless of anything, but i find it important to understand my position when i'm interacting with a person of a very different age. i avoid being too close to avoid any uncomfortable situation, since what i seek is just solace for me and for everyone !<br>
if you're too younger or older than me, please don't feel bad ; i still am glad to have you here and i wouldn't reject your interactions. i love making friends and i love having my heart connected with different people from all over the world ♡ !!<br>
i believe that if i keep cautious about what kind of relationship it's healthy to have with people, everything can turn out okay.. !<br>
<br>
<br>
please don't forget to give me feedback, suggestions and questions for future content ♡ !<br>

hiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WBtDHoi.gif"/><br>
so many things have happened in last weeks .. i'm a little overwhelmed, even ; ;<br>
but i'm trying my best to rest and respect my relaxing time !!<br>
it's always hard keeping a routine and schedules, since my body and my mind not always agree with what i'm supposed to do.. but this is also part of a healthy routine !<br>
sometimes we need to adapt the schedule to respect our time and not get too tired.<br>
it's actually common for me to have a full lazy day and the next day i feel super motivated to do all tasks for three days.. !<br>
the important thing is to not pressure myself to follow the routine 100%, since it's supposed to be helpful and not a bother. if i'm doing my weekly tasks and resting properly, everything is ok !!<br>
<br>
so .. you may have noticed some very "drastic" changes in all my social media,,<br>
i was already making a sort of cleaning, but this time.. i just couldn't keep doing it.<br>
i decided to finally stop this pain and actually delete my accounts and make new ones !<br>
i have now new accounts for my "not bad" project ; my social media accs <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PCwccpM.gif"/><br>
i mean, only my tumblr blogs are the same, but i changed urls : now it's @pufti and @pofti, which is really cute and match ( for real now )<br>
as you already know, i don't use social media for personal content but to post actual helpful stuff.. maybe not thaaat helpful but i always try to post things that can be inspiring, motivational or just make someone's day a little better <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FmAlHc.gif"/><br>
my old accounts were not really making this project work very well.. but well, i'll write more about this in the q&a !<br>
( i already made the necessary edits in the faq and the project page )<br>
<br>
it took me a while to know what i should post on my new instagram acc, since i would like it to be something original and helpful ..<br>
i was thinking of using it as a "spam" acc, but my posts ended up being more helpful than i expected,, so it ended up becoming a "self care" acc !<br>
my posts are all stuffies and the next slides are screenshots from the "help" page of my site ( yes, thiiis one )<br>
i always wanted these tips to reach more people, and since not everyone is used to personal websites and stuff, this was a good way for me to actually help more people !!<br>

isn't it cute ? i'm proud .. ; ;<br>
my acc is full of friends and mutuals that i love very much.. ! many precious and sweet people. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/T6GBoM4.gif"/><br>
i want to keep it a healthy and safe environment there. i want to motivate them to be happier and feel valid !!<br>
<br>
i also started doing "story games" and even a "mood calendar" to entertain everyone while helping them with self improvement !<br>
i used the "small moments" once and the "mood calendar" for a week, but i don't think i'll continue using them myself since i'm making a new diary where i'll write things down in a more private way <img src="https://i.imgur.com/73rqGP2.gif"/><br>

modesty aside, i honestly think it became much prettier than i expected ..<br>
and i'm so happy because my aesthetic is inspiring other people !!<br>
i always feel my heart warm when i see that people are being inspired by me ///<br>
<br>
today, the text will be about this renewal of my internet life !<br>
a complement to a text i've written before, about "numbers".<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
i'm little by little getting more and more clean of the "numbers", and it's making me feel really good and refreshed.. !<br>
now i officially got rid of all of my social media with big follower numbers. yes, i did my best there, i spent time and effort posting content, but now it's time to refresh things.<br>
i was just really tired of all of this.. random strangers following me just because of a random viral post, creeps messaging me, my accs turning to feel important and platforms treating it like nothing.. so stressful !!<br>
i writed my reasons, and i honestly think these changes are an improvement for me and the quality of my content ♡<br>
even if not using social media for posting personal content, it's still the best way to reach people and make friends. this is what i wanted, from the begin, and just now i'm being able to actually reach people's hearts !<br>
the thing is,, my accs with lots of random people and artificial interactions were consuming my patience and time and i couldn't actually interact with others because it wasn't even safe to try approaching them ; people were also thinking i was distant and hard to approach. i want to have more time for healthy relationships and for myself.<br>
now with my new accs i want to be more spontaneous and helpful to others, i want to make friends and approach people safely, i want to be able to interact with my friends and be there for everyone who needs me, i want to support people i admire and i want it to be soft !! i want my life to be softer, in general.<br>
i'm happy to say that this is becoming reality ♡<br>
i'm ironically being able to reach a higher number of people now than before, not with just cute stuff but my feelings too, and i believe it's because i'm doing better and being more sincere. i now can say i truly care about every single people that interact with my posts, because i can actually enter their accs and see they're trying their best too !!<br>
this is what being "mutuals" means to me : to have our hearts connected by the same motivation and energies. even if i am not in fact "mutuals" with all my followers, i always look at their profile and check from time to time if they are active and if they are good people. i don't want ghost followers and people who never care about my content, i'm going to try to keep a proportion of followers and interactions as reasonable as possible from now on ! my large accounts always had infinitely less interactions than the number of followers, which means that obviously many of those accounts were inactive or people who didn't even care about who they're following. i don't want it anymore. i want real people, a comfortable and safe ambient for me and everyone ! the internet can be a place full of illusions. i believe the numbers are one of the most dangerous illusions.<br>
i feel lighthearted now, and i'm being able to communicate with others better and doing what i wanted from the begin : reaching your hearts and soften your feelings !<br>
i couldn't do it if my heart wasn't soft, right ?<br>
i feel softer now.. i'm happy life made me see how artificial and unnecessary all these numbers are. i learned that real people are important ; kind and lovely people, who will be there. ♡<br>
and i will be there, too ! even with the distance, i am here.<br>
<br>
i hope i can inspire you to improve your internet life, too..<br>
is it really healthy and safe for you, right now ?<br>
<br>

it's 2019 !!!<br>
i hope this year is full of happy memories for all of us ♡<br>
i took a while to have the energy to do this post, i'm in a bad phase ; ;<br>
summer is a hard time for me, especially when it comes to sleep ..<br>
my sleep routine is a mess, i'm tired all day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oo6x07s.gif"/><br>
i want to improve it.. i want to feel more energetic so i can do my projects !!<br>
<br>
anyway, i'm feeling happy ♡<br>
i went through some sad moments but with the support of my loved ones i was able to overcome all this and to learn many things <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XBEw3Wi.gif"/><br>
i know all difficulties are important because it's with them that we face problems, fears and insecurities and we improve !!!<br>
if you are going through something hard now, remember this.. everything will be better soon !<br>
<br>
i have today to show you a collage that i'm very proud of <img src="https://i.imgur.com/piFKEDh.gif"/><br>
i've been saving images with this aesthetic for a loooong time, i love this theme of strawberries and hearts ♡ !<br>

<br><br>
so.. double q&a !!<br>
the first one will be a complement to something i've written before, about age regression. the second one will be about "role in life" ♡<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ଢ ⅰ<br>
i've been thinking about age regression lately, because i really am into all kind of age regression activities and stuff.. but i still know that i don't really age regress, because i'm always like it.<br>
i don't really feel a difference when i'm coloring or eating using a cute spoon, because it's just my personality. i could say everytime i'm feeling comfy i'm regressed, but i don't really feel it as a thiiing, because it's just who i am.. !<br>
i think age regression is valid, because it really is important for some people to find their purity and innocence again.. and i still really like being into agere activities and stuff, but i don't consider myself into the "little space" thing ( i'm talking about non kink age regression, i'm just using the expression.. ) because if so, i would constantly be into it, and the thing about regression is exactly the contrast between feeling adult and childish.<br>
i have matured a lot and learned things through the time, but the way i see the world and my personality definitively is the same as ever, because this is exactly what i value !<br>
when i think about myself with 8 years old, i can see clearly that i'm the same, and will always be. i don't need to regress.<br>
i want to keep myself pure and innocent, imaginative, positive.. i always try my best to remain all the good important things about myself, even if sometimes i have to be really adult and strong, i'm still being myself all the time.. i'll never change, just mature and get better and smarter !!<br>
i can be an adult and still be the same as always, just changing moods and choosing important personality traits for each situation ! i can have childish interests, because my interests are important, it doesn't matter if it's childish.. i also have lots of grandma interests like embroidery, baking, and i know i'm not a grandma ( yet )<br>
of course adult stuff is really stressful, so bubu always help me.. he takes care of me. is he my caregiver ? yes, but i also take care of him ! we always help each other in everything ♡<br>
since i've remained the same, i don't feel the need to regress, because i'm already regressed. i'm just myself.. always !<br>
if you have a hard time being yourself and feeling comfortable about your interests, personality and behavior, don't feel guilty about regressing.. there will be this contrast between feeling big and small that will make you feel like wanting to regress all the time, but someday you'll also feel always just like yourself, and be really happy about it ♡ !<br>
it is possible to be pure, innocent, happy and comfy even as an adult.. and i'm trying my best to get there !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
　ଢ ⅱ<br>
the meaning of things is usually something melancholy to think about, since although things all happen with a reason, these reasons are so vague and neutral that they don't satisfy us. things happen because they need to happen, but they can be painful and it's impossible to stop the pain. for example, we feel sad if we are lonely, but we also feel sad if we love people and they are gone ( and one day they will ). it's inevitable.<br>
but i don't like to think of things in a pessimistic way, so i've always focused on something that i call "my role in life". this is what i must fulfill and that is what motivates me every day. it's something very simple, but at the same time so complicated.. to be happy.<br>
nothing in life makes sense if you're not happy, but anything and everything becomes magical if you feel happy. it doesn't really matter if that was fate or not, if happiness is just chemical produced by your brain, because the feeling is magical and welcoming. all good feelings : excitement, comfort, satisfaction, passion.. all of them are the goals in our lives. if nature has given us such good feelings to encourage us to keep going, i believe that is what we should do.<br>
i realized that to achieve my happiness i must have a pure heart, full of love.. i need innocence to enjoy all the wonderful little things of life in complitude. if i had been born in different living conditions, with another DNA, i certainly would not be the one i know today. i would not have learned or experienced the same things, so i would be someone else ; but that doesn't diminish for me the importance of purity. it's not about fitting into some pattern of pure and perfect angel, but rather embracing with all your heart all that your life has offered you until today and thereby forming your personality in the most positive way possible. every single person have purity, every one may be the best within one's own existence.<br>
something that makes me truly happy is to be able to teach how to be the best version of yourself, spreading happiness, love and sharing everything i've learned to this day. although i can't reach many people, although i can't really interfere with their lives and make them happy, i do my best. i want to continue to the end of my life being as happy as i can and helping other people as much as i can, especially the ones i love.<br>
some people will never learn to be happy, some people will never truly love. perhaps, the life given them did not bring enough information. maybe they just have a different way of seeing life. i believe it doesn't matter the way you see things, your personality or your appearance, for these are just consequences of your life, easily moldable. what matters is that inside your heart you can feel the warmth and magic that is love. if you love, you can become better, there is hope ♡ !<br>
<br>
mm i'd like to thank you, if you really read everything i write ..<br>
means a lot to me ; ; ♡<br>
this is my valentine's day gift for you :<br>
