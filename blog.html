i'm having lots of ideas for projects, but it's hard to organize time for all things <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jWbPi5L.gif"/><br>
i'm planning new things for the store, i'm sooooo happy with the progress !!!<br>
things are definitely exceeding my expectations ♡<br>
i'll not tell you my plans for now, since i still have to try hard to make it happen the way i want it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/f8eY1ju.gif"/><br>
i just have to thank you a lot for the messages and the affection i receive, it makes me always motivated to do my best ♡ !<br>
<br>
this post will be a little long, so i'll start right away with the things i did last week !<br>
i'll start with this beautiful collage, which i was planning to do for some time :<br>

it's truly an ethereal aesthetic, don't you think ?<br>
i believe that no one is better than her to represent it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Eodogd5.gif"/><br>
it was a great experience for me to deal with so different color tones together !<br>
i feel like i usually run away from dark colors on almost anything, but they also represent a part of who i am, it's important that i practice more how to use them within my aesthetic !<br>
<br>
here's the melody i used, i think it matched perfectly :<br>

with kinda the same aesthetic, i made a page in html that is very simple, but it is somehow very important for me.<br>
of course, with matching url ( soft.root.sx )<br>
i've always wanted to do something like this in html, but it's strangely time-consuming, even though it looks so simple <img src="https://i.imgur.com/P7CUMWo.gif"/><br>
it's pretty nonsense, but i really put some feelings into it, so i hope you like it ♡<br>

um, as i've been writing a lot lately, i can't help but put two texts per post <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nsTCGtl.gif"/><br>
i'm just extremely inspired, i really hope it's not tiring for you ///<br>
the first one is about cuteness & femininity, the second one is about group behavior !<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　✄ ⅰ<br>
people have always had a problem with female stereotypes. there is pressure on the girls to be always cute, feminine and delicate. i totally disapprove of people trying to shape the personality of people for the purpose of making them "ideal" within stereotypes ; although girls and boys have hormones that bring tendencies in tastes, desires and looks, a person's sex has no relation to her personality, since that is something much deeper. i agree that girls and boys should not change their personality with the intention of feeling "fit" in society, since this behavior causes sadness, confusion, problems and unhealthy relationships.<br>
but, in the search of freedom of aesthetics and mannerisms people began to always treat these feminine adjectives as if they were something inferior and undesirable. i have read countless times about how "being cute and delicate is desirable in society because they want women to be weak and controllable", and no, that's not a correct way to talk about it !!!<br>
the cuteness, delicacy and elegance are feminine characteristics, and just like the masculine characteristics, are tendencies but not facts. a girl may have more masculine characteristics, and vice versa ; there is nothing wrong with that. in nature the feminine and the masculine work together and form all that exists of good ( and bad ), it's the balance of things. the personality of people is complex and there are no sex tendencies that change a person completely, so of course you should not change who you are because of that ; but wanting to reject your natural feminine qualities because you somehow think that male qualities are better, is a very serious problem. it is actually offensive to the female image.<br>
makes me deeply sad as people speak as if being soft and delicate is a sign of weakness and inferiority when there is no connexion between these things. to say that being feminine is a bad thing and that we must fight not to appear feminine and delicate for not to be treated in a bad way is so extremely wrong !!<br>
girls and boys in nature have strength, endurance and power equally, only represented in different ways. matriarchal and patriarchal societies are focused on these forces : motherhood & paternity. these are the most natural and pure in both, both take care of each other as family, both have different but equally important roles. the problem is that patriarchal society often makes it seem that the male strenght is desirable and important, that physical strength, dominance, and logical reasoning are the best, that emotional intelligence, kindness, and wisdom are weak. this is not true, because there is not one better than the other ( and i've written about this before ).<br>
in fact, the female image is also very associated with beauty. this obviously doesn't mean that girls should be beautiful, but i would like to comment that this type of beauty is associated with health and youth, since it is something that is naturally bright and wonderful related to fertility. in this way, while healthy, pure and natural, feminine beauty is something that i appreciate a lot and that i also think should not be treated as objectification ; the real objectification is the plastic and artificial way the girls force themselves to be to have social approval.<br>
so yes, if your personality have cuteness and femininity, it doesn't mean that you are inferior or childish. you should not be ashamed of it or try to become more masculine ( even if you are indeed a boy ). you must above all embrace your natural qualities and your personality traits as your strength and importance in society exist anyway and are great. you can have an even submissive personality, and that doesn't mean you don't have the right to be happy like that and have control over your life and your actions !<br>
just remember that you deserve to be happy and respected, you are strong and lovely no matter how feminine or masculine you are, you can - and should - be purely yourself ♡<br>
<br>
<br>
　✄ ⅱ<br>
this recent subject about "npc" people is something that has been around for a long time, but with other names. i really think being a npc is a bad thing, but i'm seeing people using it as a baseless curse, i see people with clear group behavior using the term to get approved and feel superior to others. i believe that this whole thing can be very productive if seen and treated the right way, so i felt the need to write about it !<br>
group behavior is basically what the idea of ​​being an npc is all about. it's about acting only in favor of the group, seeking approval from the group and always feel the need to be part of groups and overestimate this attitude as if it were something important. this is a purely instinctive and standard attitude of our species, so i believe it is natural and healthy to have group behavior during a phase of life, usually in adolescence, while we are still trying to perceive our individuality ( which has always been there, we have only forgotten who we are because puberty causes our hormones to take actions above who we really are, basically for the sake of the reproduction of the species ).<br>
the problem of such attitudes is that they separate us from purity and consequently from happiness. as we are rational animals, group behavior, although natural and to make our brain release endorphins ( as instinctive approval ), makes us take actions that do not make us really happy. the pursuit of standards, mimic behavior, obeying rules that we don't really value, following trends that don't match our personality... all of this is extremely tiring and painful for us. the npc behavior is in fact something bad and that must be overcome, because although institive, is not ideal. you are not doing your best if you are acting as a group because you are an individual.<br>
i see many people with npc behavior using this as offense because they relate specific things to "being an npc", such as using social media, having groups of friends, using slangs... but the thing is that group behavior is not something that it is necessarily shown through these attitudes, for a person can of their own volition want to have some of these attitudes, because it makes they happy. making the decision to have some natural, instinctive behavior as something that you truly value is an important and rational decision that is right for our ability. for example, i want to form a family, it's a group behavior and extremely instinctive : to live with my partner, to procreate, to take care of my group. but if i had made that decision only because it's the standard of our society, it could be sad for me and against my will as an individual ! i want to have a family because only the thought of it warms my heart and i know it is my pure wish.<br>
the desire for stamina for group behavior can be replaced by other more useful and healthy attitudes such as helping others, striving for a cause that you truly value, giving gifts, giving compliments... the list goes on !<br>
we don't have to obey our instincts, but they can guide us to important things if we are strong enough to make our own choices. ♡<br>
<br>
i hope this helps some people !!<br>

my lovely store is open and with an extremely cute layout !!!!<br>
modesty aside, i'm really in love with the layout i made ♡ !<br>
i'm so very happy to have decided to make a layout of my own. before i was not going to do it and i was going to use a platform, i thought it would make things easier ...<br>
but i definitely think it's important that my store is as cute as possible and i'd like to do my best for that !!!<br>
i used a subdomain for the store : https://shybunny.middlepot.com<br>
it's all in portuguese because at least for now i'm giving priority to sales here in brazil, but i'm accepting some of these too ( i wrote more about it on the site )<br>
<br>
so, i made yesterday a very cute new flash game <img src="https://i.imgur.com/doqIwv1.gif"/><br>
... not about halloween but i also posted one last year, remember ?<br>

<br>
today i want the post to be light, so i'll write about a slightly more personal subject, with some tips <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wkxTdyp.gif"/><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
i once wrote about myself and my personality and i mentioned how i like to organize and improve myself, and how i like rules. as i always support the purity, happiness & comfort of people, why would i support rules being imposed to shape us ?<br>
i know it can be confusing, but i actually think the rules, if handled correctly, can help us a lot to find out more about ourselves, and not shape ourselves to be something different, but the other way around.<br>
social and behavioral rules can be very oppressive and force us to act in an uncomfortable way, to make us confused under the obligation to be accepted socially above being ourselves, and happy ; but by analyzing these kinds of rules and constantly questioning them, i could see that they actually made me realize who i really am ! by reading these rules and wondering if they really fit into my lifestyle and personality, i could see clearly what i wanted or not for my life. i could understand the principles and foundations of these rules, and where they "wanted us to go". usually social and behavioral rules have the general objective that you be a nice person and don't bother other people, and that is a good thing ; the problem is that these have very specific peculiarities that don't fit for anyone. all people feel uncomfortable and unhappy if they try to follow all these rules strictly because they don't fit everyone. in short, my solution to achieving a healthy life was to adapt these rules to my way !<br>
i really like writing rules for myself and even having rules made for me, reading about all those rules and "good manners" that are supposed to make a "good person". i find it very productive and it helps me a lot to find myself individually rewriting these rules so that they still have their main good intention but in a way that is comfortable for me as a person. i can see how personally i could feel happy to follow some good, healthy rules as a way of reminders. i value a lot of rules that involve kindness, education and respect, as i believe that it is fundamental to have healthy relationships and it makes me happy ; it just happens that these rules are very "heavy" and try to change ourselves, but there are usually ways of interpreting and rewriting them that make them good and productive for our lives.<br>
it is clear that some rules simply don't fit my life at all, and should be discarded. unfortunately, even striving to keep polite and sincere with people who question me about such "weird" attitudes that i choose for my life ( for example refusing to be in social events supposed to be important to my social life, but that doesn't make me happy ) people will still judge me negatively because i didn't obey "the rule". this is something we naturally suffer as a consequence of being truly honest and kind to ourselves, but it is also an important process in the pursuit of purity.<br>
i really care about evaluating my behavior, in general. when we are busy with our tasks we may forget to take care of ourselves, so i believe it is very important to always stop from time to time and think "how am i feeling ?", "is my body feeling well ?". stop for drinking water, wash your face, eat a fruit, walking, adjusting the lighting... these simple things are primordial to maintain our physical and mental health. like this habit, when i'm interacting with other people i always evaluate my behavior to see if i'm expressing myself properly, if i'm being kind, sincere, if i'm being myself, if the conversation is being comfortable for me and the other person. this may seem maybe a little "obsessive", but if done in a healthy and natural way is very good and greatly improves our quality of life. all these "rules" are about doing my best and not letting myself get carried away by the things of life and forgetting about my health or being nice to people.<br>
it's primordial not to expect other people's approval and social validation when defining your rules and lifestyle, but rather how you personally, from the heart, feel about it. of course, you will feel happy and satisfied in being a good person and not messing around, but it is completely different from pretending just to receive compliments, to feel included and correct. the most correct and valid you can be is yourself ♡<br>
<br>
i know it's a little difficult to understand, but i hope i have explained it clearly !!<br>
happy halloween for you, be careful not to eat toooooo much candy <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cwyTIFV.gif"/><br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZhgJgb8.gif"/><br>
i'm so excited ♡ !!!<br>
i'm finally ready to start my online store, shy bunny <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FYD71ij.gif"/><br>
i took pictures of all the items and i will post them in the next days !<br>
i'm going to do disclosure on my main fb page, which has similar aesthetics, and i also plan to make a giveaway.<br>
unfortunately, for now, this store only works for brazil, but i can deliver small items to other places if anyone has an interest. just contact me ♡<br>
i'm organizing everything the best i can <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dy3FvOr.gif"/><br>
<br>
so.. there are lots of political issues going on because of the elections here ; ;<br>
very stressful <img src="https://i.imgur.com/b44NCpX.gif"/><br>
i would like to make it clear that i don't like to give opinions on politics, economics or any subjects that i don't have proper knowledge to write about.<br>
i know it is important, but i don't feel comfortable posting opinions on subjects that i have not studied properly, i hope you understand !!<br>
( i'll add this to the faq )<br>
<br>
going back to the fun subject, i plan to post lots of cute crafts from now on !!<br>
i'm very happy about this, since it is something as important to me as my digital works.<br>
lately i've been pretty excited about trying different aesthetics for decoration, i'm always saving new material and i get inspired easily !<br>
i always have real strong tendencies for decorating everything with my main aesthetic ( because it always warms my heart right away ), but i believe my secondary aesthetics also represent important parts of who i am. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vVXYiJQ.gif"/><br>
i think they deserve some love too ♡<br>
i'm having lots of fun trying new color combinations, different textures... i feel that i'm improving a lot.<br>
today i'm going to show you a very nice chubby teddy bear, that will be in the store :<br>

i also have something today that i've been forgetting to do for a long time ( i'm sorry /// )<br>
i recorded an audio in portuguese, with the story of the "pink little bug", that i wrote !<br>

i think it's a good story for before bed, what do you think ? <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bSzCqHQ.gif"/><br>
<br>
i would also like to post here a simple drawing that i painted.<br>

<br>
in this post i have an important thing to talk with you, besides the main q&a subject.<br>
i want to talk about why i gave up using the feedback buttons on my website, as well as the hit counter !<br>
( yes, a lot of text lately, i hope it's not a problem ; ; )<br>
<br><br>
<center><sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/></sub></sub>　<b>q & a</b>　<sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></sub></sub></center>
<br><br>
　ⅰഒ<br>
since i wrote my "honest post" to you i reflected a lot about my attitudes. whenever i write something i do it initially to improve myself. i changed the way i treat my photos, i felt the need to clarify a lot of confusing things for you about personality and behavior that might be useful.. but i still felt very upset about the numbers on that site.<br>
i decided a few days ago that i want to stop using the feedback buttons as well as the hit counter. i've never really liked the idea of ​​exposed numbers because people always take them too seriously, above the quality of content... they really think that numbers represent something important when in fact it's not realistic or impartial ; ;<br>
i started using them because i liked to have feedback, but i think it turned out to be something not very relevant at some point... i'm not devaluing your clicks, but i prefer feedbacks with constructive words, tips and opinions, not just one approval or disapproval number. this has not really helped me improve, it's nothing compared to the messages i get. people are not numbers, they are individuals with real and important opinions and feelings. i want real opinions.<br>
to be honest, i was very happy to see the numbers growing, but i know that they don't represent much of anything other than the site is growing in visits ( which is good, but overvalued ). the numbers are mostly positive, and i feel extremely happy about it, but it's definitely exaggerated. reading true and honest messages from the visitors proved infinitely more enriching for me, even the shorter messages were written by someone who really wanted to give their opinion.<br>
social media have created this need for big numbers in people and even after partially abandoning social media altogether i have tried to use the feedback button system in my favor here, and it was quite useful at first, but i feel that i don't have more reasons to keep it here than to praise a false reputation for my image on the internet. i'm just a normal person doing my best, just like any other producer on any other website. i reflected a lot on this and people treating me differently because of numbers is not something that i value and i don't think is good for me or the visitors. the race for numbers and fame is not the kind of thing i'd be proud to encourage on my site ( or anywhere else, but unfortunately that's not always an option ).<br>
i kept the numbers exposed despite not approving their overvaluation because i believed it could bring public ; maybe people could took me more seriously if i had big numbers ? maybe they could allow themselves to look at the site more easily if they saw this "seal of approval" from previous visitors ?<br>
... but is it really worth blinding people with such superficial information and then saying it's not important ?<br>
i have come to the conclusion that i must be an example and show that appreciation of numbers is not healthy or productive.<br>
i felt free from this race for numbers as i moved away from social media, and i discovered over time that frequent visitors of my site are not here either by the numbers, but by the content, just as they are on other interesting sites and blogs of the internet. it definitely warms my heart to know that neatly my work honestly attracts so many people ♡<br>
so, i removed the feedback buttons from all the pages of the site ( except, of course, from the archives ) and made some changes to the layouts ( because i'm inspired ). i removed the hit counter from the index, although i still know how many ips visits my site, this is more for technical information. i'm going to increase the frequency with which the chat is open, so i decided to keep only one of them, moving the messages and smilies from the look book chat to the main chat, so i can have more control over it. consider these changes as a purification, it's extremely invigorating to be free of ego needs and social fears ~<br>
i hope hiding the numbers and keeping the written feedback in evidence is more productive for me and for you ! i wish from the bottom of my heart that you participate more avidly in this site, and not in the form of numbers, but as wonderful and real angels, which is what you are to me. ♡<br>
( remembering that i love exchanging long emails and letters, so be sure to get in touch with me at letters@middlepot.com if you want to talk to me )<br>
<br>
<br>
　ⅱഒ<br>
this subject is not so questioned but some people are curious to know what religion i have, since i occasionally write things that seem kinda religious..<br>
basically, i'm a paganist ! i do not consider myself anything more than that. i am a daughter of mother nature ; nature is my god and goddess, it's everything to me. nature guides me in all difficult times and has always helped me to make the right decisions, nature makes me feel at home wherever i am, it is because of her that i'm learning to see beauty in all things and to value the things that really matter and that make me happy. following my role in nature is my dream and guiding others to happiness & comfort is my passion ♡ !<br>
i often thank nature for everything i am blessed to enjoy in the most unexpected moments. i make prayers to bring good energies to the ones i love. i feel a lot of motherhood in nature and so i usually refer to it in a feminine way, but nature also has paternity depending on the moment so referring in a masculine way can happen. i have always been very attached to nature and mythology has always been a very great interest, i have always believed from the bottom of my heart in magic and in the magical beings who secretly play their role in nature & i utterly love to make offerings for these beings who take care of me and of whom i love. i also greatly appreciate sympathies and rituals that bring good energies and help us connect with nature. i usually do these things from my heart, instinctively, so i'm not part of communities or specific religion within paganism, although reading about these things is something i absolutely love doing.<br>
i always feel a very strong bond with fairies, angels and rabbits. i believe there are some particularities of my being that are the same as theirs, so i identify a lot even though i am a human. the role of the fairies in nature, the protective wings of the angels, the purity and maternity of the rabbits... these are virtues that i long for ♡ !<br>
i believe in faith as much as in fate. in my view, both are forces that work in our lives. when fate is absolute and yet your faith goes beyond limits, that's how miracles happen. i believe that the destiny is something that has no relation to us and where is our luck, as long as faith is composed of energies that make up our essence ; so we can also mess up our luck with negative thoughts, it's important to be careful with our feelings.<br>
i unhesitatingly believe in afterlifes, i don't have a clear vision of what it is, but i believe it is certainly something very fruitful for our soul, full of new opportunities ! i also believe in other types of lives simultaneously happening, in secret from us ( other realities and other worlds, like our dream world ).<br>
lastly, i would like to comment that i believe that all religions and personal beliefs of each person are important and that if the person is being guided to be better each day, they are certainly following the right path. i accept with all my heart any prayer and good blessings that anyone sends me. i love feeling connected in peace with other people so i love all kinds of expressions of affection, religious or not ♡<br>
<br>
i wish you all the joy and solace !!!<br>
