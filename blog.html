what do you think ?<br>
i think it's lovely <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ChuJWcI.gif"/><br>
<br>
for today's q&a i decided to write about a rather controversial topic,,<br>
i, indeed, feel a bit of apprehension. but i believe you will understand my point of view <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xi8VIDT.gif"/><br>
( please consider that this is the way i feel comfortable about dealing with it within my lifestyle )<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
because of some things i've said before, people ask me about this : i'm not vegan, but i'm trying my best to be 100% cruelty-free !<br>
veganism is not just about diet but also about products and lifestyle. i am completely in favor of using only cruelty-free products, which are not tested on animals, anything that is not natural and causes suffering is something i completely repudiate. having a healthy and natural lifestyle is something that i try hard to have ! well, i support all that part of veganism about being cruelty-free, but not the part of the diet. it's something very personal, so please don't take it as a criticism, it's just what i believe.<br>
i'll start with the meat : i don't think eating meat is anything wrong, cruel or bad to do. it's a natural part of life and i see no problems about killing to feed. obviously, this goes a long way, since humans are not necessarily carnivorous, and we also have the rationality to avoid such things, but meat was ( and still is ) a very important part of the diet of most humans. not all people can really avoid the meat and replace it, it's very cultural and complicated. my biggest problem with meat is the cruelty involved in the process, animals that are bred only to die and live miserably, it makes me very sad and angry. a second problem are the hormones given to the animals so they grow up faster, it's extremely bizarre and disgusting, it does SO bad for the health of anyone !! for these reasons, i am seeking to limit myself to just eating meat from animals that have been properly reared, with a healthy, natural life, as was formerly the case. this is hard to find and also very expensive, but like i said, we do not need meat to survive anymore, so i think it's very plausible. i just can't eat meat from tortured animals like it was normal.<br>
now, about milk and milk products in general, there is a big controversy about whether milk is bad or good for people's health. milk is obviously the most important food for a baby, but that is breast milk. the milk of other animals is not really needed for us, but if eaten properly, it can be very healthy. the milk can not be consumed in large quantities, but i don't think that it does bad unless you have some intolerance or allergy ( which is quite common, but not everyone has ). for me, the biggest problem about milk is how animals are treated horribly and full of hormones, same problems as meat. so i have to really do a lot of research to find good sources.<br>
about eggs, it's a very important part of the human diet since ever, but of course, it can be replaced. however i have no problems with eggs, just with the treatment of animals, just like the above cases, i look for good sources.<br>
commenting briefly, wearing fur and animal hide is horrible when they kill animals only for the luxury of vain humans. the skin and leather removed from animals that were killed for food is not something i see problem ( although i have problem with rearing animals in most cases, as i said earlier ). the skin of animals that died in natural ways is something i have nothing against !<br>
finally, i want to comment on honey, which is somewhat controversial among people who adhere to veganism. i am not against honey or beekeeping, bees do not suffer in the process, it's quite the contrary, they live much better by having humans protecting them. they produce much more honey than they need, and using this extra honey is not wrong. the problem with beekeeping is that it should not be done all over the world, and it is. honeybees should not be living all over the world, but humans carried them everywhere, just for convenience. typical ignorant selfishness. the problem still is not for the bees but for other animals, other pollinators are extremely harmed by having their habitat invaded by bees that should not be there. different types of bees are natural from specific places. i support the breeding of bees in their proper habitats ( in reasonable quantities, obviously, the overpopulation of bees is not good anywhere ). this is not so difficult to find, since you can know the source of the honey you buy. depending on where you live, if it's one of the appropriate places, there may be local creators you can support ! research is the key for a good lifestyle.<br>
<br><br>
um, as usual, i didn't intend to write that much ; ;<br>
but i hope you understand my point ///<br>

hiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9CA8vG4.gif"/><br>
many new things are coming soon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2417xmz.png"/><br>
as you may know, some of my projects have been standing for some time because of some important things i've been doing lately. i'm actually quite busy with these things, but i've been reflecting on all my projects and realized that i should not let them totally stand still for so long. they all exist for a reason and keeping them active would help me a lot to practice my skills in different areas, after all they were created to motivate me to study and always be using my creativity ! also, they have a story behind, i care for them.<br>
i always value my hobbies because they make me happy, even if i know i'm not so talented at everything i do, i think it's worth doing my best to keep doing it. i will continue updating all my projects even if it is with a lower frequency ; being occupied with other things is not a justification to abandon them ! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/luE544t.gif"/><br>
i'm feeling pretty motivated so i'm certainly updating all my projects.<br>
<br>
some people liked it, so today i have again some little things that i have embroidered :<br>

so ?<br>
i think it's very cute <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PUJ4Ggb.gif"/><br>
<br>
maybe you have seen that i posted a new html stuff, an aesthetic virtual journal !!<br>
i had this idea randomly when i was doing collage. i love doing this and i always have several journals with different aesthetics, stationery is one of my big passions ! i also like to put pieces of fabric, ribbons, buttons, even beautiful packaging.<br>
i've always wanted to somehow do this digitally, but i have never really tried, until now. it's actually easy, and a lot of fun ♡ !!<br>
i took the opportunity to offer you some cute thematic materials that you can use for decoration, digitally or even printed. not all the stuff that i offer in these packs are mine, these are just things that i have saved here, so if anyone doesn't want their content to be included please let me know ///<br>
i intend to keep making new pages, so stay tuned <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sWD1PMF.gif"/><br>
the domain is literally cute ( cute.home.kg ) and i'll leave a backup file for every page i make :<br>

<br><br>
so.. this may seem like another personal q&a, but i consider it more as an important observation about how you see me and also other people.<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i would like to vent some things because i receive several messages and i know that although i am not of great influence, i still have responsibility with people who expect things from me and see me as an example in any aspect. it's natural that you overestimate me, since i'm on the internet and just post my best ; but it's important that i be modest & honest enough with you so this is not a problem and make you have the wrong idea about me ///<br>
everything i'll write here i hope you also remember when observing other people :<br>
i usually say my personal opinion on these q&a texts. this is important to note, because although i always hope to be helping someone to think about these issues, i never expect you to agree with what i say or assume as correct. is my opinion, my point of view, the way i thought to get where i am today. tomorrow i can change, and i hope so. if i change, i will tell you my new thoughts. you may have a completely different view of the things i write here and be happy in your own way, but at least for me it is always good to see other people's sincere opinions to refine mine. read my texts as an external opinion, think carefully about it and think about your own opinions.<br>
i am not perfect. that's obvious, but people tend to think girls on the internet are perfect. i can say that i always do my best and i work hard every day for this. i'm not super talented in most of the things i do and so i'm always studying and practicing. i post the best i do, even if not super good or important things, because i like to receive criticism. it helps me a lot to improve ! my own opinion can help me, since i'm a perfectionist, but sometimes we're just tired and let it go, you know. i can say that i am today the best and most perfect that i could be, within my experiences and reality. tomorrow i'll be better, and so on. if i have to be an example to someone, i want to be an example of motivation, because you should never copy others and try to be like them, you have to be yourselves and the best you can be in this way !<br>
i would also like to talk about my appearance, even though i rarely post pictures of myself, this is a serious topic, since the biggest negative influence that internet girls give others is their perfect ( super edited ) photos and the lack of integrity in saying they are not perfect in real life...<br>
so, about me, being quite honest, i think i am pretty. other people have always said that i am pretty, but that doesn't seem true until i clear my mind ; i like almost everything about my appearance, what took time to happen, since i have my insecurities as well. i still have some things about myself that i would like to improve, and i intend to do so in the future. although i take great care of my skin, it is very sensitive and i usually have allergies from time to time, so i have some spots that i could not repair on my own. there are procedures to help with this, but they are a little expensive, so at the moment i just accepted, these are marks of difficulties that my skin has gone through, that's okay. and i'm very lucky because all the skin that is exposed, like my face, has no marks, so it's something that only those who know me more intimately have already seen ; ;<br>
obviously, anyway, my skin may look like porcelain in the pictures, but in real life it's normal skin, i have pores, you know.. i take care of it a lot and i have to clean and moisturize every day to keep it nice, just like everyone else ! i do not wear makeup often and i always use sunscreen, so i think this helps a lot. i can talk more about skin care in another post, as well as about makeup i use.<br>
my pictures are pretty blurry and have filters, not only because my camera is really bad, but also because i like to make the pictures a little blurry to soften everything and to use filters to adjust the lighting. i do it with all the pictures, not just those of my face, if you notice. when i have a better camera, i can try to take more natural pictures, i would like to try !<br>
last, but not less important, numbers : numbers are not something you should ever take as a basis for success, numbers are extremely inconsistent and are not always real people. even the numbers you can see on my website may seem like a big deal, but they are not consistent as well, since they count the same ips over and over again. and this a problem that exists even on large websites, or do you really think millions, billions of people watched the same video as you ? then, you should only consider real people, always. and a large amount of public is not always something to be proud of, since many people who are not good, lie a lot & are toxic, have many fans. always think of those people who send you sincere, truthful messages that not only praise you but also want you to improve as a person. these messages are what i always consider important and i love receiving them ! i get sad about receiving rude messages, especially when they don't make sense, but even some rude messages can help me mature and improve. i always ask people to be kind to each other, but if i made you angry for any reason, do not hesitate to tell me the reasons, because i don't want to hurt anyone, i am always open to improving and learning new things. i'm no better than neither of you, i'm just better than myself every passing day. we're all here to help each other, not to act superior !!<br>
never support people who make you intentionally feel inferior and less capable than them, who make you feel ugly and useless. you can always be a great person, smart, mature, beautiful, you have the right to have hobbies ( even if you're not so talented right now ) ; you can be perfect, within your reality. your personality may not be 100% ideal, but you're sure to find the balance so this will not get in the way of you improving and being a good person. be pure, be yourself, always ♡<br>
( oh, and, it's okay to feel sad and negative sometimes, making mistakes is normal, we just have to work hard not to keep it that way )<br>
<br><br>
did my huge text help motivate you in any way ? i hope so <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3gkUBIB.gif"/><br>

have you noticed, over there ? that's right, ssl !!<br>
i know this is kinda silly, but i was actually thinking about getting "https" on my website for a while.<br>
i'm quite proud, do you remember about the post where i said "i probably will not be able to make all the necessary adaptations or change all links everywhere" ?<br>
it took some time, but i did it ♡ !!!<br>
( and also with all the other domains with my html stuff )<br>
<br>
i'd like to talk a little bit about my projects that are a little stuck,,<br>
at the moment i'm working hard on a game with bubu !<br>
he got the main idea, i created the characters and i'm now writing the whole script ( which takes a while ) <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gVFT5Yh.gif"/><br>
he will deal with the programming, i don't think i will draw the concepts, but we are still planning this part.<br>
we've had lots of ideas for games together and we've finally gotten started with one of them, i'm super excited !!!!!<br>
i will not tell you about what it is yet, but you will know soon !<br>
oh, and i didn't forget the shy bunny store, of course. i just had financial problems these times ; ;<br>
things are normalizing and i'm saving money again to start the shop and for all my future plans. i'm working hard the best i can !<br>
my dream is to have a ( physical ) stationery store, that also sells crafts, accessories, clothes, plushies and all things cute,,, that is also a cafe ♡ !! ( of course things will be separate but the thing is that it's the same establishment )<br>
i have been practicing a lot of cooking and baking lately <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AsZa0Mn.gif"/><br>
it will be super comfy and cute, i have so many ideas for decoration and everything. i know that i will be able to realize this dream, even if it takes time, i will do my best for the future !! i always feel so happy to work with things that are beautiful and make people feel happy, it's literally the best thing in the world for me.<br>
life is a surprise pot and we should never stop dreaming about what will come out of it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xl53EkP.gif"/><br>
<br>
recently i've gone back to drawing some little things in ms paint and i did some cute things that i liked a lot !<br>
here i am going to show you a drawing of myself that just happened :<br>

melissa is my name. i really like my name, but i don't use it on the internet because it would be difficult to find me, you know. melissa is the name of a plant, the lemon balm. it is common for people to use this plant to make tea and for medicinal purposes. it has very small, white and delicate flowers. the meaning of this name is literally "honeybee", which makes people give some interesting interpretations to it. some people gave me the nickname "mel" ( which means literally honey ), but they usually call me melissa.

this is actually more a surname than a name, but i use it as a nickname on the internet, as well as some variations of it ( mimi, midpot, mimipot ). it's not a real surname, i discovered it in a dream. at the time i was thinking of a nickname to use on the internet and i had just created the "crwel friends" project, so i was thinking about many things and characters, especially potatoes. i used the nickname "poteto" from time to time, because of that. one day i dreamed about potatoes and many other confusing things, including a very fat and giant cat that called me "melissa middlepot". he told me "you're bigger than your potato friends, but there are still bigger potatoes, believe me", even though i was not really a potato. i know it's weird, but the dream was in portuguese, except for the surname "middlepot", so it's a bit hard to explain LOL. well, i woke up really thinking that middlepot was good, it sounds like some english surnames. so, yes, i believe that "pot" is from "potato". be honest, "middlepot" is pretty cute, isn't it ?

i have been asked a few times to make lives here on the internet, but it's not so often, the most common is that people ask me to do things personally, publicly.<br>
for example, i studied cello for a few years in a music conservatory. i had no problems playing cello for one person, but i was always invited to try to participate in concerts. i never wanted this, but i felt bad because it was something that everyone expected of me, "for my evolution". why couldn't i evolve without hundreds of people staring at me ?<br>
when i was a child i was always asked if i would like to be a model, but i always denied it because i didn't like the idea, i was never the kind of person who liked to receive attention from many people. i always felt suffocated and uncomfortable in being in the presence of many people, especially when they were all looking at me.. very horrible for me, really.<br>
i even denied taking ballet classes as a child because i was afraid to participate in live performances. i knew i would be obligated, i didn't want that. however, i wanted to dance, so i ended up training alone at home and ended up enjuring my foot because of excessive exertion on the fingers. maybe i can never dance ballet because of it. i could have taken classes right, but they didn't give me the opportunity. they only talked about "when i would dance on a stage". i know no one wanted my bad, but it still hurts.<br>
at school and college i was forced to present projects in front of the whole class, it is common to do this at school. this has always been very traumatic for me, although i always strive to be all right. i went through bad times with these uncomfortable situations, i tried to force myself to change and feel confident, but that was not really the problem. even when i did everything perfectly right, i was not nervous, i didn't say anything wrong... i never felt victorious. it has never been pleasant to "overcome" this, because i have never overcomed, my personality is not something overcomable. even when they applauded me and said that i did very well, i always felt that it was not right and that i was forcing myself being something that i was not.<br>
i don't want to have to pretend and force myself to do things that don't give me pleasure because people think it's important and that "i'm going to get over it". i don't like doing anything with several people staring at me. i don't like being in the presence of many people and i don't like receiving attention from many people at the same time. is suffocating. i'm not insecure about what i do, i'm not afraid of failure, i'm not afraid of criticism, it's just uncomfortable.<br>
i always like to record and post things that i do to receive constructive opinions and criticisms for my improvement. i like people to see my things. i just do not want to be something that i'm not, please.<br>
i admire the work of people who perform live performances and concerts with skill and confidence, but i'm not a weak person or inferior to them for not liking doing these things. i was born that way and it's not something i want to change, at all. it never got in the way of developing what i wanted to do.<br>
i hope you understand this, i really wish i could continue to share content with you without feeling the pressure of living bad experiences. i made mistakes that i regret a lot, trying to change who i am, this is impure.<br>
