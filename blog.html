hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4mJZ0fF.gif"/><br>
have you noticed, over there ? that's right, ssl !!<br>
i know this is kinda silly, but i was actually thinking about getting "https" on my website for a while.<br>
i'm quite proud, do you remember about the post where i said "i probably will not be able to make all the necessary adaptations or change all links everywhere" ?<br>
it took some time, but i did it ♡ !!!<br>
( and also with all the other domains with my html stuff )<br>
<br>
i'd like to talk a little bit about my projects that are a little stuck,,<br>
at the moment i'm working hard on a game with bubu !<br>
he got the main idea, i created the characters and i'm now writing the whole script ( which takes a while ) <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gVFT5Yh.gif"/><br>
he will deal with the programming, i don't think i will draw the concepts, but we are still planning this part.<br>
we've had lots of ideas for games together and we've finally gotten started with one of them, i'm super excited !!!!!<br>
i will not tell you about what it is yet, but you will know soon !<br>
oh, and i didn't forget the shy bunny store, of course. i just had financial problems these times ; ;<br>
things are normalizing and i'm saving money again to start the shop and for all my future plans. i'm working hard the best i can !<br>
my dream is to have a ( physical ) stationery store, that also sells crafts, accessories, clothes, plushies and all things cute,,, that is also a cafe ♡ !! ( of course things will be separate but the thing is that it's the same establishment )<br>
i have been practicing a lot of cooking and baking lately <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AsZa0Mn.gif"/><br>
it will be super comfy and cute, i have so many ideas for decoration and everything. i know that i will be able to realize this dream, even if it takes time, i will do my best for the future !! i always feel so happy to work with things that are beautiful and make people feel happy, it's literally the best thing in the world for me.<br>
life is a surprise pot and we should never stop dreaming about what will come out of it <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xl53EkP.gif"/><br>
<br>
recently i've gone back to drawing some little things in ms paint and i did some cute things that i liked a lot !<br>
here i am going to show you a drawing of myself that just happened :<br>

yes this post is going to be a bit long, but today the q&a will be double..<br>
i want to stop writing many personal topics in a row so i'll just answer both already ; ;<br>
the first one is a curiosity about my name, the second one is something important. both will be in the faq !<br>

melissa is my name. i really like my name, but i don't use it on the internet because it would be difficult to find me, you know. melissa is the name of a plant, the lemon balm. it is common for people to use this plant to make tea and for medicinal purposes. it has very small, white and delicate flowers. the meaning of this name is literally "honeybee", which makes people give some interesting interpretations to it. some people gave me the nickname "mel" ( which means literally honey ), but they usually call me melissa.
<br>
<br>
　｡ ･ * . ♡ 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑡
<br>
this is actually more a surname than a name, but i use it as a nickname on the internet, as well as some variations of it ( mimi, midpot, mimipot ). it's not a real surname, i discovered it in a dream. at the time i was thinking of a nickname to use on the internet and i had just created the "crwel friends" project, so i was thinking about many things and characters, especially potatoes. i used the nickname "poteto" from time to time, because of that. one day i dreamed about potatoes and many other confusing things, including a very fat and giant cat that called me "melissa middlepot". he told me "you're bigger than your potato friends, but there are still bigger potatoes, believe me", even though i was not really a potato. i know it's weird, but the dream was in portuguese, except for the surname "middlepot", so it's a bit hard to explain LOL. well, i woke up really thinking that middlepot was good, it sounds like some english surnames. so, yes, i believe that "pot" is from "potato". be honest, "middlepot" is pretty cute, isn't it ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
i have been asked a few times to make lives here on the internet, but it's not so often, the most common is that people ask me to do things personally, publicly.<br>
for example, i studied cello for a few years in a music conservatory. i had no problems playing cello for one person, but i was always invited to try to participate in concerts. i never wanted this, but i felt bad because it was something that everyone expected of me, "for my evolution". why couldn't i evolve without hundreds of people staring at me ?<br>
when i was a child i was always asked if i would like to be a model, but i always denied it because i didn't like the idea, i was never the kind of person who liked to receive attention from many people. i always felt suffocated and uncomfortable in being in the presence of many people, especially when they were all looking at me.. very horrible for me, really.<br>
i even denied taking ballet classes as a child because i was afraid to participate in live performances. i knew i would be obligated, i didn't want that. however, i wanted to dance, so i ended up training alone at home and ended up enjuring my foot because of excessive exertion on the fingers. maybe i can never dance ballet because of it. i could have taken classes right, but they didn't give me the opportunity. they only talked about "when i would dance on a stage". i know no one wanted my bad, but it still hurts.<br>
at school and college i was forced to present projects in front of the whole class, it is common to do this at school. this has always been very traumatic for me, although i always strive to be all right. i went through bad times with these uncomfortable situations, i tried to force myself to change and feel confident, but that was not really the problem. even when i did everything perfectly right, i was not nervous, i didn't say anything wrong... i never felt victorious. it has never been pleasant to "overcome" this, because i have never overcomed, my personality is not something overcomable. even when they applauded me and said that i did very well, i always felt that it was not right and that i was forcing myself being something that i was not.<br>
i don't want to have to pretend and force myself to do things that don't give me pleasure because people think it's important and that "i'm going to get over it". i don't like doing anything with several people staring at me. i don't like being in the presence of many people and i don't like receiving attention from many people at the same time. is suffocating. i'm not insecure about what i do, i'm not afraid of failure, i'm not afraid of criticism, it's just uncomfortable.<br>
i always like to record and post things that i do to receive constructive opinions and criticisms for my improvement. i like people to see my things. i just do not want to be something that i'm not, please.<br>
i admire the work of people who perform live performances and concerts with skill and confidence, but i'm not a weak person or inferior to them for not liking doing these things. i was born that way and it's not something i want to change, at all. it never got in the way of developing what i wanted to do.<br>
i hope you understand this, i really wish i could continue to share content with you without feeling the pressure of living bad experiences. i made mistakes that i regret a lot, trying to change who i am, this is impure.<br>
<br>

where do you live, is it getting hot or cold ?<br>
here is a super nice climate, a gentle cold, soft sunlight + the rains have stopped completely. it's my favorite weather season !!<br>
for those who remember the past post, my trip with bubu was magical, i would like to travel with him all the time ♡ ♡ ♡<br>
it's not usual for me to travel, i sometimes spend years without leaving nearby. i want to travel a lot in the future <img src="https://i.imgur.com/V6FLtp7.gif"/><br>
<br>
i made two new playlists recently and would like to comment on them because i think they are interesting !<br>
i made a playlist with only brazilian music, since i was born and live here ( in são paulo ). i decided to do it because i know that the brazilian culture is extremely diverse and yet stereotyped. it's a country with a diversity of immigrants, so people don't usually know much about many super nice things that are from here. if you think of brazilian music you will definitely think of samba, but i do not particularly like it, as well as many people here.<br>
in this playlist i put together some popular music that everyone knows here and that were part of my childhood, only music i like and listen until nowadays !<br>
most of them are from the 80s and 90s, but these are the ones i really like. i think currently music here is not good at all ...<br>
but i would like to talk more about brazil, things that i love here and things that i consider terrible, the changes as the decades went by and my plans for the future,,, in another post ( spoiler : i do not intend to live here forever ).<br>
well, i hope you like the songs because they are great and very special for me ! i'll add more as you like.<br>
<br>
the other playlist that i would like to talk about is the asmr one. it's a playlist i've been thinking about for some time, since i usually watch a lot of asmr channels that are not very well known and many videos that i like are asmr not intentional. you will find all kind of stimmy and aesthetically pleasing videos !<br>
most videos are from japanese and korean channels, but some videos are in english and portuguese.<br>
i hope this playlist will help you relax and discover new content !!<br>
maybe you can even learn to make some recipes <sub><sub><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jdce4lV.gif"/></sub></sub><br>

these drawings are so lovely !! her name is julie ♡<br>
i really enjoyed painting the little flowers on the dress, it was very relaxing.<br>
<br>
today i decided to answer to you several doubts and curiosities related to the changes that have happened in my social media over the last years.<br>
<br><br>

　　　𝚖𝚊𝚒𝚗 𝚙𝚊𝚐𝚎 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚝𝚞𝚖𝚋𝚕𝚛 𝚋𝚕𝚘𝚐 𝚊𝚎𝚜𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚝𝚒𝚌 𝚌𝚑𝚊𝚗𝚐𝚎𝚜 _<br>
i created the page with a friend and the tumblr blog later, in order to improve the content of the page, improving its aesthetics. the problem is that our opinions were very different and she posted things very different from me, so everything was a mess. so far so good, but the biggest problem was that she liked to post things from kink blogs and lots of offensive stuff that i think it's very bad and ruined the page environment completely. our friendship dissolved over time ( not only because of that ) and she decided she didn't want to post on the page or tumblr anymore for lack of time, so i erased all the content that i definitely hate and left everything clean and neat again. posting alone i could have control over the content quality and aesthetics. i hope that everything has been completely deleted, i'm very ashamed of this past. if you find anything, PLEASE let me know !<br>
<br>
　　　𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚏𝚊𝚗 𝚙𝚒𝚌 𝚍𝚊𝚢 _<br>
who knows the not bad page since its beginning remembers that saturday was a day where i posted pictures from followers. the intention was to post beautiful pics that matched the aesthetics of the page, but things didn't go very well.. saturday became a very annoying day, people only sent super edited selfies and poor quality pics, even super inappropriate ones. and if i didn't post those pics, people would get really mad at me and keep spamming more and more photos every day !! of course one day my patience was over and i had to end it. i deleted all the pictures.<br>
<br>
　　　𝚖𝚒𝚍𝚍𝚕𝚎𝚙𝚘𝚝 𝚙𝚊𝚐𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚝𝚎𝚗𝚝 _<br>
this page was made to post my personal stuff + things that inspire me. it was before i started making this website, it was my last chance to use a social media as a personal space and of course it wasn't a good idea because it's facebook, even if a fb page, it's still fb, and i don't like it at all, i just like to post aesthetics there. i wasn't able to post my stuff properly, only images ! so, i gived up in a few months, and stopped posting everything personal, even images. i started making this website, and continued posting art that inspire me on this page, because it's still nice to post and people can get inspired too ! i really like to spread the art of talented people.<br>
<br>

this story is quite complicated and people are always doing theories and <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/PsOlNuM.png" target="_blank">posting</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/I4WhevB.png" target="_blank">screenshots</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/rm1AqD9.png" target="_blank">about</a> <a id="uhhh" href="https://i.imgur.com/O5ETyMe.png" target="_blank">it</a>.. i think it's time to say what really happened to my ig : i used my acc for a short six months ( approximately ), problems began to happen at three months, i couldn't stop following people or following more people, my acc was frozen for about a month like this. i ignored it, but then i could no longer comment, they just vanished. then things started to get really heavy : my pics were erased randomly. sometimes it took a few days, a few hours, sometimes it was instantaneous, it would always disappear. i was already with many followers to that point, i was losing many because my account was becoming a mess. i was upset and contacted the instagram countless times, until one day they said that my account had been hacked. they did nothing about it really so i changed the password several times, but the problem persisted, random comments and pics were erased all the time. i always put the link of my ig on fb pages, so i had many followers, but when i started to suspect the activities i told everyone to stop following me because i would make another account, so i lost a massive number of followers ( i don't know if this was really the cause of the loss of followers because it was really a lot ). i deleted most of the pics, i left only 15 there and i didn't use the acc anymore. i decided not to make another account at all because of the problems and how nobody did anything to help me. the acc is still there until today.<br>
<br>
<br>
are we clear now ? i hope so !<br>

hiiiii fluffies <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QwgXhbN.gif"/><br>
i would like to thank once again the support you give me, it is really very special for me !!<br>
the ideas you give me are very useful and i never tire of saying thank you <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3ubYtGu.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4xWUuUR.gif"/><br>
because of my routine post yesterday i received some messages thanking the inspiration for organization and productivity, but i also received some rather sad messages saying that they couldn't be productive or follow schedules like me.<br>
i would like to clarify that although schedules are important, it is not always possible to follow them.<br>
sometimes i go to sleep later than i intended, sometimes i wake up with a headache, i don't force myself to go beyond my limits <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrqO7A4.gif"/><br>
everyone has different limits, you don't have to do multiple tasks every day, you don't have to wake up at 6:30 am, it's different for every person !<br>
your routine should be tailored to your lifestyle and your chores and hobbies should be things that you feel good doing, and i didn't include household chores in the routine because they vary according to need, but i have these as well, every day <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LTuY6k2.gif"/><br>
it's important to be productive but it's also important to stay healthy and happy, never forget <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qjiy032.gif"/><br>
<br>
soooooo, i'm super happy these days because tomorrow, day 5, me and bubu have completed 5 years of dating ♡ !!!!<br>
we're going to take a little trip together and i'm super extremely excited and i dream about it every day !!<br>
i love him so so so so so much <img src="https://i.imgur.com/g5pvtoc.gif"/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ANrPV0v.gif"/><br>

next time i want to record something in portuguese, i think it would be interesting.<br>
what do you think ?<br>
<br>
so /// because of yesterday's very personal post with information about my personality, some people asked me to post some things about my body as well. i thought a lot about it because it's very intimate and i don't like to post so many things like that ...<br>
but i decided that i'll post, since these are information that anyone who knows me personally would know, there is nothing so secret about it.<br>
i'll add these in the faq :<br>
<br>
✂　my height is 5,5. average, i guess ?<br>
✂　i weight 117 lbs. i think i'm skinny, but not super skinny, i'm okay.<br>
✂　i don't want to share measurements here, but i really like my body shape ! according to my measures, i'm hourglass figure.<br>
✂　my skin is pale, but not super pale. i hate tanning because my skin is really sensitive and turns red only ; ;<br>
✂　my hair changes color very much according to the lighting, but it also becomes clearer if i go out in the sun. it's dark blond / light brown and sometimes it gets a little bit orange, but it's only noticeable in the sunlight.<br>
✂　i like to keep a "himecut" in my hair, with short side bangs ( it's cute but also a bit more mature than straight bangs ). i cut my hair myself. i'm lazy so it's common for my bangs to be super long + my hair is quite wavy, so the cut is not so noticeable.<br>
✂　my eyes are between blue and green ( cyan, turquoise ) + a little bit grayish.<br>
✂　i don't know my shoe size to be honest, but my feet are 24cm.<br>
✂　um... i'm a-cup ;////;<br>
<br>
... of course i would not leave the post with just that, it would be shameful.<br>
i have something much more important to post on today's q&a, super very extremely important :<br>
<br><br>
<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d81T42M.gif"/>　<b>q & a</b>　<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gCof63R.gif"/></center>
<br><br>
i would like to talk about these two adjectives that are so confusing to people : pure & innocent.<br>
these are actually extremely important things, but are treated as something far, almost impossible to achieve. and that's not true, because it's something we can all go back to.<br>
to explain it better, let's define purity and innocence :<br>
purity, as i have already commented in other posts, is something that you are when you're being yourself. when you act naturally and follow your heart, when you do not listen to what others think is good for you, but what your heart says is best for you. your heart wants you to have a clear conscience, want you to stay safe and healthy, wants you to be happy. it's not always the easiest path, but it's always the right one, the pure one. purity is literally not be contaminated by external influences. it's hard because we live in society and we need to please others, but it doesn't mean that you need to change who you are ( not even a little bit ) to be a nice person, and be happy.<br>
innocence is something that people often confuse with ignorance. when you don't know things by choice, you are being ignorant, which is a bad quality. innocence is when you see the world in a beautiful way, when you believe in your dreams, believe things can get better, do not judge others before you know, when even after being bitten by a dog, do not you think all dogs are evil. so, innocence is more linked to positivity, it's a quality of being radiant and full of love, even having gone through difficult things, or not. of course it's easier to be positive when you don't have traumas to deal with, but that's not the point. it is possible, and it is necessary for you to be happy !<br>
children are pure and innocent because they have not been "contaminated" by society's pressure to be different from who they really are, to give up their dreams, to think the world and people are bad and it's always getting worse. this is not right and it's not true. it's a super toxic thought.<br>
other ( nonhuman ) animals are like children forever, for at least none of them still live in society like humans. society itself is not a problem, but people just don't have the maturity to deal with it in a healthy way. it's something that people should educate themselves and educate their children so that we can all be happier !!<br>
never think that you have no hope, that you are dirty or rotten, that your dreams can't come true, that magic doesn't exist. erase it forever from your life !!! learning to evaluating your behavior and the way you see the world is very important to becoming a better and more satisfied person. believe in your dreams, make the little you from the past proud of who you became today ♡ !<br>
<br>
i really hope it touched your heart !<br>
